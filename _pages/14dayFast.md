# 14 Days with No Food

I'm embarking on my longest fast to date -- 14 days.  Extended fasting
is a health practice.  I can already hear people say "you gotta be
safe".  And they are right.  What most people don't understand is that
I'm fasting BECAUSE I want to be safe.

I'm hesitant to write this -- what if I don't make it?  I'm an
experienced faster.  With my doctor's advice I fasted 5 days once a
month for a year.  I've taken a break for a few months.  And, well, it's
been difficult to restart the practice.  I've written extensively on
this and will include a link at the end to a series I wrote on the
health benefits of a 5 day fast.  I decided to be open about this
journey in hopes that it helps me with my resolve.  I don't like failing
in front of people.

Thing is, there is no way to fail a fast.  About half of my monthly five
day fasts did not last five days.  One thing or another would come up,
and I'd end the fast.  And that's the right phrase.  I "ended the
fast".  I didn't fail, I merely fasted for 3 or so days instead of the
5.  A three day fast did my body good, it's a victory to celebrate.

Why 14 days?  It's a challenge and it would do my body good if I could
make it.   The thing about fasting is that it's actually hardest the
first and second day.  After that, hunger isn't much of an issue.  The
"I want to eat" because it's pleasurable is more my challenge.  I like
eating.  So, once you've done the hardest part, why not go for a while
benefitting from having the hard part behind you?  

Keep in mind that I am an experience faster who has done his homework
and talked to his doctor.  You can read The Complete Guide to Fasting by
Dr Jason Fung.  He was the doctor that first educated me about fasting
as a way to overcome Type 2 diabetes.   I'm currently reading The Oldest
Cure in the World: Adventures in the Art and Science of Fasting by
Steven Hendricks.  There are some excellent reasons to do an extended
fast.  But I'm not looking to heal a particular ailment, I am fasting
for the most obvious reason of all.

Why am I fasting at all?  To eat my fat.  "Losing weight" doesn't really
describe the challenge.  I want to lose my excess, unhealthy fat.  This
isn't about looks, or how my clothes fit (or rather, don't fit).  This
isn't for my self esteem or for how others view me.  I simply have
excess fat that is harming my health.  I lost a good amount of weight in
the first year and a half of this journey.  I've gained half of it
back.  I've been gaining weight for a year now.  It's time to put a stop
to that.

Eat my fat?  It's the only way you can get rid of fat without surgery. 
No matter what type of diet you go on, no matter what form of exercise
-- to get rid of fat your body has to burn it for fuel.  Running your
body while you aren't eating is what the fat is there for.  I could go
an easy 6 months without eating.  Truly, I have that much and more fat
on my body.  So, I'm going without eating for 2 weeks, but I'm not going
without food.  I have plenty of food stored up.

I also need a mental reset.  I've heard so many tell me "I wish I had
your motivation/discipline".  Someone who has great discipline in their
eating doesn't get morbidly obese in the first place.  It's a battle for
me as it is for anyone else.  I've been too lax, gave myself too many
excuses to eat off plan.  I hope one of the benefits of this fast will
be to reset my relationship with food.  

I will be emphasizing getting rid of this unhealthy fat as my priority
for 2024.  A single two week fast is not going to get me there.  It will
get me started.

# That Time Exercise Was Bad (Day 2 of my 14 Day Fast)

I was in my 30s and a couch potato. A friend suggested we work out
together. We maxed out every muscle group. Lifted to failure for the
biceps, triceps, upper leg, lower leg, abs. Yeah baby...we went hard!
OMG - the next day I felt like I had been hit by a truck. I was so sore
I could barely lift a glass of water to my mouth. It was another two
decades before I lifted weights again. Exercise was bad for me.

Clearly exercise isn't bad for people and not for me. HOW I exercised
was the problem. Nobody who had any knowledge or experience would have
taken a couch potato directly from nothing to lifting to failure. It
could have been a learning experience, instead it turned me off.

I thought of this as people reacted to my attempt at a 14 day fast. As
part of my fast I'm writing blog articles as a form of journaling. I
appreciate all the support I received to my post even those challenging
me. It adds fuel to my fire.

It may have taken me a long time to learn the lesson from that day of
idiocy, but I truly do look before I leap now. I did not see some TikTok
and decide "yeah, I think I'll fast for 14 days". I'm two and a half
years into my health recovery journey. I've read over 30 books on health
in that time. I've put what I learned into practice.

I've been fasting for two and a half years now as well, and doing 5 day
fasts monthly for more than a year. I didn't START with multi day fasts.
My health has improved tremendously.

But - and here's the big but - I write about my journey first and
foremost for me. It's my journey and writing about it helps me. Hundreds
of people have written to me that my journey has inspired them and they
have also improved their health. Nothing makes me happier, but still, I
write mostly about my own journey. I talk about the good and the bad.
It's not medical advice for other people.

What I do for me may not be appropriate for someone else. I know this.
That's why I put the disclaimer at the end of each post. What I do may
not even be the best thing for me. Some people have been so sure that
what I do would doom me - and not just about a 14 day fast. Every.
Single. Step. There's someone who thinks "that's bad". All you can do is
inform yourself and make the best choice you can and adjust as the
results warrant. That's what I do.

Jumping into a 14 day fast without any education, without any
professional support, without any experience in shorter fasts - well -
it might be great anyway, or it may be a lot worse than waking up
incredibly sore.

At the end of my announcement of my fast, I did not add "come do what I
do". I have no idea if you are ready for such a fast or if it would be a
terrible idea. What you can emulate in me is becoming a full participant
in your health. Listen to your doctor, but don't ONLY just listen to
your doctor. Educate yourself. Listen to a variety of ideas about what
works for others in a similar situation as you.

Anything can be bad for you. Taking meds can harm you. Not taking meds
can harm you. Exercising can harm you. Not exercising harms you. Fasting
improperly can harm you. Eating all the time and the wrong things can
harm you. One person can eat peanuts no problem. Another person dies
from it. You have to make your choices and place your bets.

I took a chance by following the book The Diabetes Code by Dr Jason
Fung. There's someone even now saying how bad that is - and people from
the beginning told me diabetics couldn't fast. "It's dangerous!". I was
on 3 meds and even so my A1c was 11.2 (that's bad) and I was to start
insulin shots in addition to the meds. I'm off all meds and not only am
I below the diabetic level, I'm back to a normal A1c. Been off the meds
for 2 and a half years. I was walking with a cane and driving with a
handicap sticker. And now I run 5k's and sprint intervals.

Some people would let me know "you got healthy the wrong way". Well, to
be sure, what I do for me may not be the best for you - it may not even
be the best for me. But I do what I can. It's all any of us can do.

It's the end of day 2. All is well. I felt hungry at times today but it
wasn't too bad. A slight headache as well. The naysayers are helping me
stick to the course. So I thank you. And of course I thank all the well
wishers.

# You Can Do Hard Things (Day 3 of 14 Day Fast)

Just finished day three of my intended 14 day fast. There is no doubt
that fasting is hard. However, it's equally true that you can do hard
things. Much of what is worthwhile in life is hard to achieve. Hard is
not the same as impossible. You can spend your life looking for easy
paths or you can embrace the hard.

When I considered embarking on this fast, it felt daunting. Even though
I'm an experienced faster, I knew that I half the time I started a five
day fast, I stopped short. And yet, I've been doing hard things all
along. One of the hardest for me was ceasing eating after dinner. I
still struggle with that. Changing my diet was hard. Learning to cook
was hard. Not eating until noon and finish eating by 6pm was hard. My
first multi-day fast was hard. I have learned that I can do hard things.

Extended fasting may seem unusual and impossible. It's merely hard.
Consider how hard it is to run a marathon. Year after year, people who
have never run at all embark on the goal of running a marathon. Many of
them do so BECAUSE it's hard. It's a challenge and rising to achieve it
has rewards all its own. There are well established plans people follow
to go from "not a runner" to "running a marathon". It's hard work.
People can do hard things.

But why fasting? I have far more reasons to fast than I do to run a
marathon.

1\. \*\*Enhanced Fat Loss\*\*:

\- I have a lot of fat to lose. A LOT of fat to lose.

\- Excess fat harms your body - it' not about looks, for me.

2\. \*\*Improved Insulin Sensitivity\*\*:

\- Helps lower blood sugar levels and improves the body\'s response to
insulin.

\- Crucial for managing or preventing type 2 diabetes.

3\. \*\*Increased Autophagy\*\*:

\- Promotes cellular repair and renewal by removing damaged cells and
recycling proteins.

\- Contributes to better cellular health and longevity.

4\. \*\*Reduced Inflammation\*\*:

\- Can lead to a decrease in chronic inflammation markers.

\- Beneficial for heart health and reducing the risk of chronic
diseases.

5\. \*\*Improved Cardiovascular Health\*\*:

\- May lower blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and heart disease risk.

\- Supports overall cardiovascular function and health.

6\. \*\*Enhanced Brain Health\*\*:

\- Can stimulate the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF), supporting brain function.

\- May reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases.

7\. \*\*Boosted Growth Hormone Levels\*\*:

\- Fasting can increase human growth hormone, important for muscle
growth and metabolism.

\- Aids in muscle maintenance and fat metabolism.

8\. \*\*Potential Longevity Benefits\*\*:

\- Some studies suggest fasting may contribute to longer life
expectancy.

\- May slow down aging processes at the cellular level.

9\. \*\*Mental Clarity and Cognitive Benefits\*\*:

\- Many report heightened mental clarity and focus during fasting.

\- Can contribute to improved cognitive function over time.

10\. \*\*Detoxification Process\*\*:

\- Aids the body in eliminating toxins.

\- Supports liver health and overall detoxification pathways.

Yes it's hard, but there are lots of reasons to do this hard thing.

Day three is in the bag. I felt good all day. I walked the dog for an
hour. My blood sugar was 81 and my ketones were in the moderate ketosis
range (means I'm burning fat for fuel). And yes, I had times of hunger.
Today wasn't nearly as hard as the days that were part of my "training".
I have done hard things and I can do hard things.

I encourage you in the transforming of your own mindset to embrace hard
deeds that will bring you health and vitality.

# Saturday Push Day on Day 4 (of a planned 14 day fast)

It's Saturday and on Saturdays I push my limits to make my heart
stronger. As I'm in the middle of my first 14 day fast, I went for
gentle exercise. Fasting is already a stress on the body compounding
that with high intensity exercise might not be the smartest thing. I may
change my mind later - but for my first fast of this length, I'm
sticking to moderate exercise. On my 5 day fasts, I exercise as normal:
walks, runs, HIIT, strength training have all been fine.

I went on two walks for about an hour and a half. I felt good. My
arthritic knees always feel terrific at this part of a fast. I thought
that was all I would do. But around dinner time I was feeling hungry.
Why not do a workout?

I did about 30min of aerobics with my VR headset. I do love the
Supernatural workout app. They had a new routine set to Queen's music.
Wonderful. It was a medium intensity workout and I just kept myself to
less intense movements and swings. My heart rate was zone 2 for half and
just over zone 3 for half. A very nice, moderate workout that has me
feeling great.

My blood sugar reading was 82, my liver knows how to do its job. Four
days into a fast so the stored glycogen is long gone. The liver turns
fats and proteins into glucose the brain needs, and burning fat for
energy produces ketones which the brain loves. My breath ketones were
13, where 10 is optimal ketosis. Burn fat...burn!

My poor dog Henry. He's having to fast from treats. He's a beggy boy,
and I always give him a little something when I eat. My wife is back
from visiting the grandson so perhaps he'll have success with her.

I'm still in known territory. I've fasted this long many times. I think
having a goal much longer has made these four days easier. I'm not
"striving for that finish line" - as tomorrow isn't going to be the last
day. Four days down, ten more to go. Man that sounds like such a long
time. For now I'm feeling fine. I did have a couple momentary cramps.
Electrolytes, which I take, will deal with those. I'm not sleeping quite
as long but I'm not tired.

At day four, I'm through the transition into fasting. Unlike a marathon,
it doesn't get harder the more miles you run. The hardest part is the
first couple of days. Ten more days like today - it's not going to be
easy, but I feel like I can do it. Time will tell.

# Developing Willpower (Day 5 of a 14 Day Fast)

I'm fat. Way too fat. I've lost a considerable amount of weight on my
2.5 year journey to reclaim my health. Yet, for the last year I've
gained half of that weight back. I've improved my health and fitness for
sure, but excess fat is its own health detriment. Getting back on track
was my main motivation as I was approaching that 300lb mark.

The longer you fast, the more fat you burn. Once you wrap your head
around the fact that you've stored away fat SO THAT you can keep going
when you have no food, long fasting makes sense. It's just hard. There
are more benefits, but it's the fat loss that I'm most interested in at
the moment. The question remains - how am I going to say no to eating
for 14 days?

It will take willpower and discipline, of course. I hear folks
compliment mine, while saying "I sure wish I had your willpower".
Clearly I didn't have sufficient willpower to keep me from eating the
food that makes me fat. But willpower can be created, improved and
reclaimed.

How? By doing the things that take willpower. More willpower than you
currently have. If this sounds like building muscle - that's because it
is the same. How can you bench press 200lbs when at the moment you can
only lift 50lbs? By trying to lift 55lbs. If you keep only lifting the
50lbs all you will ever be able to do is lift 50lbs. You can't go
directly from 50 to 200. But you can get there by trying to do more than
you can currently do.

Fasting for 14 days sounded awesome to me as I was reading The Oldest
Cure in the World book. Some fantastic health turn arounds have occurred
for people who fast that long or even longer. But for me to say -I- am
going to fast that long, that was daunting, scary even.

It's day five and from here on it will be new territory for me. I don't
KNOW that I can do this, but I can never accomplish the growth in
willpower TO do this, unless I try. My first five day fast sounded too
hard. I talked to my doctor before I tried thinking that perhaps it
would be a good end of year effort. He said "that sounds great, you
should do that once or twice a month". What?! I was only aiming to do it
once or maybe once a year.

I went on to attempt the five day fast every month for a year. I made it
about half the time. I developed "fasting muscles". It became part of my
routine and not scary at all. It's now "known space" for me.

Do I have the willpower to say no to hunger, say no to the desire to eat
for another 9 days? I really don't know. But, I know this. I'll never
have that level of willpower unless I try to do more than I currently
can now. There will be many benefits to this fast beyond losing weight.
Developing discipline and willpower will be a life enhancement all by
itself.

It's day 5 and I have been a bit hungry and definitely had the "I want
to eats". It's totally within my power to say no. If this had been a
five day fast I'd probably have ended it a few hours early. I have nine
more days to go so I said "no, I'm not going to eat". My willpower got
just a bit stronger.

I am feeling fine. My knees feel AMAZING. They feel as good as that time
I had cortisone shots. Those worked wonderfully but they were the most
painful thing I have experienced. And the effect only lasted a few
weeks. I walked for an hour and a half today. My blood pressure was
terrific - the best reading I've had, completely in the normal zone. I
have had a slight headache at times. My breath ketones were 23ppm. I'm
burning fat baby! Why 14 days? To keep in that fat burning zone longer.
I worked hard to get here, I want to stay awhile.

Extended fasts may not be what you need to do. But for all who
compliment my willpower/discipline --- you don't need to wistfully
admire me. You can emulate me and build your own to heights you never
thought you could. You just have to do the good things in your life that
take more willpower than you currently have. I am here cheering you on.

# Started at the Bottom, Now I'm Here (Day 6 of my 14 day fast)

Day six is at an end, so I'm officially in new territory for me. I'm
feeling great, though it was a bit of a hungry day, more so than days 4
or 5. Still, it's at the annoying level, not suffering in the slightest.

Why fast so long? There are simply things that happen after days of
fasting that don't earlier. I reached what is called the "Therapeutic"
level of ketosis on day 5. That's the level that's helpful for epilepsy,
Alzheimers, and even cancer. My body is doing a lot of cleanup and
repair. My ketones (evidence of fat burning) are at 3 times the level
they were on day four. My daily intermittent fasting routine doesn't
come close to raising my ketones this high. In fact, I'm not normally in
ketosis. My arthritic knees continue to feel fantastic.

Let it burn! My weight loss rate has slowed a great deal the last two
days. That lets me know I'm past the "rapid water loss" phase. What I'm
experiencing now is a much better indication of how much weight will
stay off once I start eating again. I am quite obese, I've been on this
path for 2.5 years and still have 80lbs to lose to get to a healthy
weight.

I find that I'm waking up an hour earlier. I'm not tired during the day.
I am just ready to be up. I fall asleep just fine. No headache today.
I'm drinking copious amounts of water. What goes in, must come out. Lots
of trips to the bathroom.

I have a fairly high stress job in IT. No problems concentrating at
work. Mental clarity is one of the benefits people ascribe to extended
fasts. I don't know if I'm extra sharp, but I'm certainly not experience
brain fog.

As I was hungry, I did drink a coffee and a tea today. They both helped.
I did put a few drops of monk fruit non-calorie sweetener in the coffee.
Shhhh. Don't tell the fasting police. I don't make them sweet, I just
take off the edge of bitterness.

Today had its hard moments. This isn't easy but it's not getting
progressively harder. Tomorrow I will be at the halfway point. I miss
eating, but I'm enjoying what the fast is doing for my body.

Should you fast like me? I can't say. I would encourage you to tackle
tough challenges that improve your health. You are worth the effort. You
can do far more than you may think.

# My Doctor Says... (Day 7 of my 14 day fast)

My current doctor is not the original one that advised me to do my 5 day
fasts once or twice a month. That doctor retired and this one took over
the practice. He's been my doctor over a year and is fully aware and
supportive of my approach. I don't want to put words in his mouth, but
he works with me.

I emailed about this fast and ....

He wants me to add a multi-vitamin and we will do blood tests at the end
of the fast and 3 days after, the re-feed period.

Day seven is coming to an end and I'm going great. Feel wonderful.
Hunger is there but quiet. I was busy at work today which helps. My
blood sugar was 71 and my blood ketones were 5.0. This puts me in the
very highest level of therapeutic ketosis. If you go back to my day 1
post where I put in all the health benefits of extended fasting. While
my number one aim is fat loss, which is surely happening. I'm hoping to
benefit from the healing effects. I still have insulin resistance,
osteoarthritis, glaucoma, high blood pressure, and obesity. I've
improved my health greatly, but there is more work to do. For more
information on the health benefits of an extended fast, see my link
below.

Healing can and does happen. I've experienced much already. Highly
diabetic and on three meds, to non-diabetic free of meds for two years
and counting. No more acid reflux, sleep apnea (undiagnosed), snoring. I
went from walking with a cane to running a 5k and my arthritis pain has
greatly reduced.

Even the fat loss is healing in action. Losing weight has been a side
effect of my efforts to heal my type 2 diabetes. Now it's front and
center of my health goals for the coming year just as fitness was this
year's.

My rate of weight loss has slowed even as my fat burning is in high
gear. How is that? The first part of weight loss is going to be water as
you empty your liver of glycogen. It's exciting to see the loss but that
weight comes back and it's not the weight that is a health problem.
Burning the fat? Yes, that is what is going to improve my health and I'm
doing the absolute best that can be done at the moment.

# I Choose to Fast (Day 8 of a Planned 14 Day Fast)

People tell me "you don't have to fast you can do \<xyz\>". And they are
right for the most part. You can lose weight without fasting for sure.
Many people can improve their diabetes without fasting.

When I learned about fasting to reverse type 2 diabetes, it made sense
to me. I was facing the specter of daily insulin injections when I
finally decided to launch my journey to reclaim my health. Fasting has
been a part of it from very near the beginning.

I went on a keto diet, intermittent fasting and exercise as laid out in
The Diabetes Code by Dr Jason Fung. My doctor, who only offered meds, at
least worked with me as I followed the book. The very day I was supposed
to have started the insulin shots, I got off the last of my meds and
never looked back. It took only three months to go from an A1C of 11.2
to 6.5 and in that time eliminate the need for meds and insulin shots.
Three more months and I was below the diabetic levell.

Did you now the Keto diet came from fasting? Some doctors had terrific
success with treating epilepsy with fasting. The Mayo Clinic searched
for a way to get the same benefits but without needing to completely
fast. And thus the Keto diet was formed. It gives some of the benefits
of fasting as it is a fasting mimicking diet. And it's easier than
fasting. I consider fasting as advanced keto.

I eat a keto diet, or close to it. Except when I don't - when I eat the
foods I know I shouldn't which has led to my regain of weight over this
past year. I could choose to just get back to being strict about my
diet. And I intend to. This fast is a prelude to that.

It's a choice. When you understand how powerful and health building
fasting is, anyone would say "I want me some of that". It's the whole
"but I gotta be hungry" that stymies their curiosity. You can learn to
fast, I have learned to fast. It's hard, but so is going from walking
with a cane to running a 5k. Very hard. Very worth it.

Fasting is the most powerful tool for weight loss that I know of. It's
not the ONLY way to lose weight. Fasting allows your body to do a crazy
amount of rebuilding of health. Read The Oldest Cure in the World for
lots of examples and a rather complete history of fasting. Note: it's
written from a vegan perspective, but I am able to learn from multiple
perspectives.

Can I lose weight another way? Yes. Can I do so faster than fasting? No.
Is there a benefit to getting the fat that's making me sick off of my
body? Yes. Why keep it there longer than you have to.

Will those other ways have all the extra benefits of the healing power
of fasting? To some extent yes, but not nearly as much as extended
fasting.

I have chosen to give it a try. It's day 8 and I feel fine. Hunger
hasn't been that bad today. The last couple days I've been cold, but
it's only in the "put a sweatshirt on instead of a T-Shirt" amount of
cold. I've also had a small amount of lightheadedness when standing up.
So I'm increasing the electrolytes and making sure I'm drinking enough
water. These are both known issues that can happen. And they have been
minor. I will end the fast should I begin to feel unwell. I've done it
before. You cannot fail a fast, you can only end it earlier than you
intended.

My blood pressure readings are in the normal range. Even though I take
bp meds, it use usually in the hypertension range. My bs was 76 and
breath ketones were the most so far. I'm deep into the healthy,
therapeutic level of ketosis.

This has actually been an easy day. There was hunger at times but no
difficulty experiencing it. I can understand why some people kept going
for much longer if their days felt like this day.

I have put a lot of time educating myself while traveling on this
journey. I've had successes and failures and make adjustments along the
way. That's all any of us can do as there are so many competing ideas
and information out there. Every step of the way on this journey I have
been told that what I was doing was wrong. When the amazing successes
came despite of the predictions of doom, they merely declare future
doom.

I get it, they have different information they are choosing and I
respect that each of us has to navigate our way with no guarantee's.

It's been a good day and I am happy with my choice. 8 days down, 6 more
to go.

# Troubleshooting the Fast (Day 9 of a planned 14)

Making a health change, whether it's fasting, a new exercise regimen, or
a dietary change, inevitably comes with its own set of challenges. It\'s
a journey that will come with trials that test our resolve and
adaptability. I wrote about the time when, in an naive bid to get fit, I
went from the couch straight to maxing out every muscle group the first
day I lifted weights. The next day, I felt like a Mac truck had hit me.
Instead of using this experience as a learning opportunity to adjust and
continue, I didn't lift weights again for the next two decades denying
myself the health benefits I could have gained. It didn't have to be
that way. I wasn't the first person to lift weights. There are books,
magazines, the internet, personal trainers at the gym. Instead of
deciding lifting weights wasn't for me, I should have learned from the
experience and the wisdom of others who had gone before me. I'm not the
first one to fast for multiple days. I'm wiser now than back then. I've
educated myself so when I experienced the difficulties that come along
with fasting, I knew what to do. Here are some of the ways I've have
been troubleshooting my fast this time.

Hunger: Yes, of course I get hungry on a fast. There really isn't a cure
except to understand that hunger comes in waves. You don't have to
endure forever. Just for a time. I remind myself of my goals and I try
to keep busy.

I want to eats: I separate this from physical hunger. There is a mental,
might I say addiction, aspect. This long fast is a tool to help me
develop my will power to say no. Nothing to do except go through it.

Cramps: I had a few minor cramps. More salt and potassium. Drink plenty
of water.

Headache: Minor for the first two days. It wasn't at a level I needed to
do anything about. When you give up caffeine, you get headaches. I don't
think fasting caused it, but the withdrawal.

Cold: By day three I started feeling cold in my house. I typically wear
t-shirts and shorts. I put on sweats.

Not pooping: I don't call it constipation because there really isn't any
thing to poop out. There are some minor feelings of wanting to poop, but
no production. This started around day six.

Light headed when standing up fast: Take more salt, drink plenty of
water and...stand up more slowly. I did check my blood pressure and it
wasn't low.

All of these were manageable. It was much harder when I first started
fasting. I have learned through experience and through educating myself.
The health benefits are worth the effort.

This not a comprehensive list, rather just what I've experienced on this
fast. I'm very pleased with how things have gone. I was intimidated to
embark on this long of a fast and to do so publicly.

Day nine is coming to an end. I feel good. The hunger is there but muted
like on day eight. My bs is in the 70's, my bp is normal without needing
my pill today. My ketones are still sky high. I'm still in the deepest
therapeutic level of ketosis. The weight loss continues to slow down
closer to matching the half pound of fat that a day of fasting should
bring. I didn't want to quit as often today. I'm starting to feel
confident that I will complete this fast.

Whether it's fasting, exercising, or changing your diet - don't let
initial problems derail you from improving your health. We aren't the
first ones to try and there is information out there to help us debug
our efforts. Good health is worth all the work it takes to get there.

# Day 10 of a Planned 14 Day Fast is Done 

No long lesson this time. It's been a good day, I feel well. Maybe even
better than days 8 and 9.

Bs was 72. Breath ketones amazingly high. Blood pressure normal, though
I still need my bp med. But it's far better than when I'm not fasting.

Walked an hour and a half. I do feel a bit more tired in my walk than
normal. My arthritic knees continue to feel fantastic.

I sleep less but am not groggy during the day. I have to stand up a bit
more slowly to not get a light head. My mind is clear but I do not feel
any extra mental clarity. My mood is normal.

Today has been a good day. Terrific job news came my way. Answered
prayers, praise God.

Four more days to go. I'm feeling confident at this point that I can
finish this. I may do this quarterly.

Here's a link to a good video about someone who fasted 44 days. Explains
the science as well. <https://youtu.be/pfgM6nfWU-I?si=B2EQ6oGOioUR8lXW>

I'm doing something good for my health.

# Fasting Aids on Day 11 of My 14 Day Fast

The end of day 11 approaches and all is well. I remain in the highest,
therapeutic level of ketosis. The rate of "weight" loss has slowed but
I'm only expecting a half pound or so of fat to be burned and that's the
weight I'm working hard to get rid of. My blood sugar and blood pressure
are both great. I did not sleep well last night, but I believe that was
do to job excitement/stress. I did not do a "Saturday Push Day", will
resume next week. I did go for a walk in the cold rain. I just had too
much energy pent up and needed to walk some of it off. And my arthritic
knees continue to feel fantastic. Hunger has not been too much of an
issue. Three more days to go!

People wonder "what can I have on a water fast". The answer is "anything
that doesn't break the fast". Sticking to water only is simultaneously
the hardest and most sure to not break your fast. My attitude has been
"fasting is hard, therefore I want to get the most benefit out of the
effort". I want all the autophagy, BDNF, stem cells, white blood cells
and HGH that extended fasting brings. However, there is a place for
taking small detours that are not likely to break your fast or derail
all the benefits of a fast.

Dr Jason Fung calls these "Fasting Aids". Water only truly is best, but
if any of these help you stick to your fast, then the tradeoff is worth
it.

-   Coffee and tea: Both of them when unsweetened are the same as water.
    The last couple days I have been adding a few drops of monk fruit
    drops, a natural non-caloric sweetener. Dr Fung says a splash of
    cream might also be used. The coffee does help with hunger. I have
    not seen a reduction in my ketones with the sweetener.

-   Bone broth: There is some calories and protein in bone broth, but so
    few that it's not likely to affect much. I tried this for the first
    time last night and it really made me feel full for a while. Very
    nice. However, my ketones were indeed lower this morning, but still
    sky high. I remain in the most deep level of ketosis. I definitely
    would not just drink bone broth all day.

-   Non-caloric sweeteners: I have been using LMNT electrolytes and they
    use stevia. They even have 2G of carbs that I'm not sure where the
    carbs come from. I drink 1 to 2 a day and no impact on my ketones. I
    also had a bit of sugar free Kool-aid. I do not plan to over do
    these, plain water is still best.

Some fasting experts talk about 300 calories or so of food as being
below the threshold. You'll have to experiment for yourself, but I don't
see me pursuing any of these. I want that autophagy, and eating protein
can turn that off. Still, most all of this is theory with some studies
but there is not "this is the definite truth".

The concept of not letting perfect be the enemy of progress applies
here. Getting most of the benefits of fasting is better than not fasting
at all.

I've felt great today but I am getting tired of fasting. Not because
it's hard as it's much easier in these later days than the earlier one.
And yet, I want to continue doing my body good. I'm keeping my eyes on
my health goals and pressing forward. If I were to fast until I reached
a healthy weight, it would take about 120 days. I can at least get 14 of
those done. I'd have to do 8 of these fasts to get this fat off. If I
did one a quarter, it would still take 2 years. Sure, this is the
quickest form of weight loss - but for me, it's certainly not going to
be quick.

# Planning to Break the Fast (Day 12 of my 14 Day Fast)

As my fast is coming to and end it was time to plan for how I am going
to break the fast. My digestive system has been resting for 14 days, so
I need to introduce foods slowly to wake my systems back up. One might
experience stomach pains and "bathroom problems" if you jump right in to
eating (more at the end for rare problems).

The principles:

Carbs are the worst food to eat in this state. I want to continue the
benefits of the ketosis even as I introduce foods. Carbs will spike
insulin highly turning off fat burning and ending ketosis. As I plan to
eat in a ketogenic fashion going forward, this isn't much of a change.

Protein in small amounts. The machinery for metabolizing protein has
been asleep for a while and needs to be awakened. So I will be
introducing protein, but slowly.

That leaves fat. Not large amounts of fat or food at all, but I will aim
to be high fat as I introduce food.

The plan:

Tuesday night is the end of the fast. I wouldn't normally eat at night
(well, when I'm eating as I should). However, I will drink bone broth
and have a small dish of cottage cheese. I will also have a non-caffeine
coffee with some MCT oil. All of this a few hours before bed. That will
give my body a chance to wake up the digestion without too much being
demanded of it.

Wednesday I will have breakfast in the morning. I normally skip
breakfast as part of my intermittent fasting routine. I will have a
small amount of eggs and some kimchi. Protein and fat in small amounts
to help the body ramp up the digestive machinery but not too much to
have problems. Some people have trouble with eggs when breaking fast.
From my past experience, this is not a problem for me. The kimchi is for
probiotics. It is a fermented food filled with lots of good bacteria. I
typically tolerate spicy food so I am hoping it's not a problem.

Wednesday at lunch I will have some green beans, ham and cheese (no
bread). I love green beans and they are a very low carb vegetable. I eat
close to carnivore usually, but I'm trying to be slow in introducing
protein so I'm adding in some veggies.

Wednesday dinner will be sausage balls. I have a delicious recipe that I
will link below. I have a sour cream dip I eat with them. I love these
things, this is a reward meal. Some people plan for a longer ramp up
than this. I will see how I'm feeling and this won't be a banquet.

Afterward I plan to follow my existing carnivore/keto diet. The
intention is to be more faithful. It's the many "off plan" eating over
the past year that packed on the weight.

One of the goals of this 14 day fast was the reset in mindset and
discipline. I wanted to eat every day and was able to say no. I was able
to delay the gratification of food in pursuit of improving my health.
Hopefully I will be better armed to say no to snacking after dinner and
to not just eat fast food when visiting my kids. People often compliment
my will power/discipline. It's not a fixed characteristic. I have to
keep working on mine.

A little about the danger of referring syndrome:

Prisoners of war, anorexics, and folks who fasted to the point of
starvation or where malnourished before starting their fast need to be
very careful when refeeding. It can be quite deadly to just start eating
as normal for folks in these conditions. As I don't fall into these
categories, it's not an issue I'm going to face. But I wanted to put the
information out there.

Day 12 is winding up. I feel great. My blood sugar, blood pressure,
ketones all are wonderful. I had to use self control during the football
game. Sunday football and food go hand in hand. I made it through. I am
confident now that I will make it the entire 2 weeks.

I did my VR aerobics exercise, a medium level routine and I kept to a
moderate heart rate. 12 days without eating and my body is powered by
fat. I felt energized such that I wanted to exercise. I did tire sooner
than normal. I'm not optimizing for exercise performance - I'm working
out to let my body know that I need these muscles....go get your energy
from the fat stores.

I wore a shirt to church today that was too small two weeks ago. May it
be far too large for me by the end of next year.

# After the Fast -- Day 13, One  More Day to Go!

The fast has been successful in every way I could measure. I'll hold off
talking about the weight loss until after the re-feed. Many people
rightly ask "won't you just gain back the weight". It's a good question.
I'll say it is definitely in my power to keep the weight off. But I've
lost significant weight before and gained it all back. What's my plan to
take this jump start and keep on improving my health?

I will state at the outset that there is no way to guarantee that I
won't regain the weight. I fatten easily and it's so tough to not fall
back into old patterns. I imagine it's going to be a life long struggle.
What else can I do but keep on fighting? I'd be 500lbs if I had never
made the efforts to lose weight and just kept on gaining because "I
don't want to yoyo diet".

One of the purposes of this challenging fast was to bolster my mindset
and willpower. No one is born with discipline and will power. You
develop it by taking on challenges that need you to have it.

Intention 1: stick much more faithful to my carnivore/ketovore diet.
It's no surprise to me how I gained weight. Too many weekends of travel
and just eating junk food. I could have prepared food options, I could
have just fasted. I also have got to stop snacking after dinner.

Intention 2: resume my strength training. I really didn't do any this
year. Last year I went to a wonderful studio and doubled my strength in
a year. It was expensive, but worth it.

Intention 3: I want to take the low weight of the fast (which includes
the water weight) and by my next fast, have that be the starting point.
I need to keep on losing, not just during the fasts.

Day 13 is in the bag. One more to go! I'm excited. I was frightened to
embark on this fast and to do so publicly. I appreciate all the positive
feedback and encouragement. I loved the many excellent questions and
challenges. Even those predicting my doom, I thank you for adding fuel
to my fire.

Today my blood sugar was in the 70s, my ketones sky high, putting me in
the therapeutic level of ketosis that cancer patients and epileptics
strive for. I don't know all that my body was healing, but it was busy
at work doing so.

Today was a long work day. I can't claim any extra mental clarity as so
many report, but I can vouch that my brain is as sharp as ever. My sleep
has been disturbed but I'm not tired during the day.

I miss eating. I'm not all that hungry. I never got to the "I just
didn't feel hunger any more" point, but it's more of a mild annoyance.

I feel like I could keep going. I don't want to, but it's not for
suffering. From the vantage point of 13 days in, I understand how people
go much longer. My mantra is "a bit more, a little farther". There are
lessons to learn from this 14 day fast. I will think about them as I
re-feed and recover.

My health journey is approaching year three. The first year was about
overcoming diabetes. Sure I lost weight but that was almost a side
effect. Year two I built up my fitness. Went from walking with a cane to
running 5ks. Saturday Push Day was born. This coming year, fat loss is
my primary focus. It's not about weight, it's about the way excess fat
is harming my health. More on that in a future post.

Thank you for supporting me in my health recovery journey and I am
cheering all of you on as you work to improve your own. Healing is not
only possible, it's your body's natural state. We simply have to learn
how to give it the materials and the rest.

# I Did It! Completed a Fourteen Day Fast

![A person flexing his muscles in a park Description automatically
generated](media/image1.jpeg){width="3.611111111111111in"
height="3.611111111111111in"}

I'm over the moon right now. Day fourteen was the easiest of all as I
was busy working the whole day. I did not "suffer to the end", I
triumphantly and joyfully completed the fast.

I will be reflecting on the lessons I learned and talk about them over
time. I will say that everything I experienced was right in line with
what the books like, The Complete Guide to Fasting, by Dr Jason Fung led
me to believe. Being prepared ahead of time for what I'd be facing was
very helpful.

Not going to speak about the weight loss until after the re-feed and the
regain of the water weight/glycogen etc. I will say - I'm quite happy
with it. Losing fat was the main goal I had.

The mental challenge was the second area of concern. I did NOT have the
will power to accomplish this. I have been building discipline and will
power this entire health recover journey that I've been on the last two
and a half years. I was scared to do this fast. It's one thing to read
books about the health and healing that come from extended fasting. It's
quite another to step out and try to accomplish it.

My journey has been a mixture of triumphs and failures. I do not do the
right thing every day. How did I regain 40lbs over this past year? By
not making the right choice, not doing the good I know to do. Making
excuses, turning a blind eye, intending to do better and then not. This
past year I did great with my Saturday Push Day's. It's hard to juggle
all the balls of health, but I press on.

Why fast so long? Because I can. There is no faster, yet healthy, way to
lose weight than with a water fast. One CAN keep on fasting a long time
burning the maximum amount of fat while the body gets about the business
of refreshing and healing. It's a super power we've been gifted by many
hundreds of thousands of years of human evolution. What a privilege to
have access to this power.

Why fast so long? Because I needed to. I needed to get back to the
ability to say no to the eating patterns that have made me ill. I needed
to ramp my will power back up. I needed the character and discipline
that taking on a daunting challenge brings.

I didn't have to fast - I wanted to. I took on a challenge and
prevailed. I'm proud of myself.

Thank all of you who have supported me in this journey. When I wrestled
with doing this in front of of all to see, I only had in mind the power
of pride. I'd not want to fail in front of people. What I didn't
anticipate was the power of the encouragement and support that I
received. Thank you all, you share in this victory as you helped make it
happen.

I don't normally bring up my faith when speaking of my health journey.
But I thank God for the amazing body He gifted me with. I haven't been
the steward He deserves me to be. I'm working on it and stand in awe of
the body's healing power that He designed into it.

I wish you all the best in your own journeys. The road is hard, but you
can do hard things. You can, I assure you. Being healthy feels so much
better than food that brings illness ever tasted.

# Losing Fat While Gaining Weight - Post Fast Day 1

How can one be losing fat while gaining weight? I'm in the weight gain
phase past fast. Some people get confused by this as if "losing weight
by fasting is temporary". It's the same for low carb, keto or
practically any other way of losing weight. What's going on?

When you fast a lot of the initial weight loss has nothing to do with
fat. Eating nothing at all, and you'll burn through about a half pound
of fat per day. It's simply calorie math with 3500 calories to a pound
of fat and your BMR (basal metabolic rate) plus what ever extra you burn
through exercise. That's it. That is the maximum amount of fat you can
lose per day. And yet, I was losing 3 to 4 pounds a day in the
beginning. This comes from burning through the stored sugar/glycogen in
your liver and the associated water, plus emptying out your stomach and
digestive system. Once that weight is gone, your rate of loss slows
greatly. None of this "weight" is harming your health, it's the fat you
are concerned about. When you start eating again, you refill your liver
glycogen storage along with the water, and you have food going through
the various stages of digestion.

What is this part about losing fat while this weight comes back on? I'm
still in a deep level of ketosis. Ketones are produced by the burning of
fat for energy. Thus, I know my body is still consuming the fat - I'm
losing more fat. Even as I gain back the non-worrisome "weight", I am
losing the health destroying fat. I will see how long I can keep from
eating the kinds of foods filled with carbs that would kick me out of
ketosis and put me into fat storage mode.

I ramped up my eating slowly as I laid out in my plan. So far no ill
effects with my stomach or "bathroom issues".

I had blood work done checking my electrolytes - since your body can
deplete these when fasting. Magnesium, calcium, phosphorus and potassium
were all in the normal range. I'm not surprised as I took minerals every
day of the fast.

Dinner is done and now I practice me "say no to snacking after dinner".
It is my goal to get back to losing fat by judicious eating of the
optimal foods in the optimal quantities at the optimal time. I desire
that by my next fast I will have lost weight to the low point of this
fast. If I can manage that, I can get to a healthy weight in a year.

# Fasting and Arthritis - Post Fast Day 2

It's the second day after my 14 day fast. I'm back to normal eating -
sticking to a ketovore diet (close to carnivore). Not snacking after
dinner. My ketones are coming down but they are still sky high - meaning
I'm still burning fat at a good pace even as I continue to regain the
water weight (as expected).

One of the lessons of this fast is with regard to my osteoarthritic
knees. My arthritis was significant enough that my ortho thought I
should have knee replacement surgery. I walked with a can and drove with
a handicap sticker. He explained arthritis as a wear and tear issue. My
knees have gotten much better as I put my Type 2 diabetes into
remission. The diet I ate to fix my diabetes also made my pain levels go
down. The exercise I did for my insulin resistance strengthened my leg
muscles allowing me to walk steady and get rid of the cane. A lot of
effort later, and I was able to run 5ks without stopping. Still, with
all that progress, I am not pain free. The pain is there, every day.
It's just a much reduced level that I don't need pain remedies any more.

By day 4 of a fast my knees feel fantastic. With this 14 day fast I had
10 days feeling no arthritis pain at all. It gives me hope that some day
that might be my normal state. Clearly there is an inflammation
component and a metabolic component that has a lot to do with my
osteoarthritis pain. It is NOT about wear and tear. Well, it's not
solely about it, and maybe not even MUCH about it. More information
continues to come out with this new understanding. I'll include a link
to a study at the end.

I can't fast forever, of course. I am taking this experience as a
preview of the benefits of continuing to heal from insulin resistance
and as I lose the fat which is driving my inflammation. Who knows, with
autophagy and stem cell production that comes with extended fasting,
maybe I'll also experience structural healing in my knees.

How much have I lost? I'm still in the weight regain phase. We will talk
about that when there is a whole story to tell.

# 16 lbs Less of Lee - Why Fat is So Bad

The metric we've all been waiting for - 16lbs / 7.2 kilos of weight loss
after 14 days of fasting and a 4 day re-feed. All along I have been
focused on fat loss, not "weight". You can reliably expect about a half
pound of fat loss per day of fasting. So, 7lbs of fat gone is a nice
step in regaining my health. At the lowest point of the fast, I was down
26lbs / 12kg. That number is so exciting that I refrained from sharing.
Inevitably there is the bounce back of "weight" when you start eating
again. But it's not the fat that bounces back, just the water, the liver
refilling its glycogen stores and the food in your digestive system.
Losing about a pound a day is right in line with expectations.

I've been on a health reclamation journey for two and a half years now.
I've overcome type 2 diabetes and went from walking with a cane to
running a 5k. Losing weight was almost a side effect of the journey, the
result of the keto diet and intermittent fasting that got me off all my
meds and to a normal A1c. Now I intend to make losing the health
destroying fat the goal itself. After losing 80lbs, I gained back 40
over the past year. Time to focus and recommit.

Excessive fat, particularly visceral fat, actively harms your health. It
is not about being unsightly, or how my clothes fit - or rather don't
fit. I want to continue healing and recovering my health and abilities.
That the excess fat exists isn't the problem - what that fat is DOING to
me is.

-   **Increased Insulin Resistance**: Visceral fat releases hormones and
    inflammatory substances that can contribute to insulin resistance, a
    precursor to type 2 diabetes.

-   **Elevated Risk of Heart Disease**: It raises the risk of
    cardiovascular diseases, including heart attack and stroke, by
    contributing to atherosclerosis (hardening of arteries).

-   **Higher Blood Pressure**: It can lead to increased blood pressure,
    stressing the cardiovascular system.

-   **Increased Inflammation**: Visceral fat secretes inflammatory
    cytokines, which can lead to systemic inflammation, a risk factor
    for many chronic diseases.

-   **Impaired Hormone Regulation**: This type of fat can disrupt the
    balance of hormones like leptin and adiponectin, which are crucial
    for metabolic health.

-   **Elevated Risk of Certain Cancers**: Excess visceral fat is linked
    to a higher risk of certain types of cancer, such as colorectal and
    breast cancer.

-   **Liver Problems**: It contributes to fatty liver disease, which can
    lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.

-   **Impaired Cognitive Function**: There\'s evidence suggesting a link
    between visceral fat and decreased cognitive function or a higher
    risk of dementia.

-   **Sleep Apnea**: Visceral obesity is a risk factor for sleep apnea,
    which can lead to further health complications.

-   **Impact on Mood and Mental Health**: There\'s a potential link
    between visceral fat and an increased risk of depression and
    anxiety.

There were other reasons and benefits to a fast of 14 days which I've
talked about. Losing fat, though, was the number one intent. There are
many ways to lose weight but nothing beats fasting. It's a tool I am
choosing to use. This fast was uncharted waters for me. I truly did not
know if I could do it, or how it would differ from the five day fasts I
had been doing monthly per discussions with my doctor. It was difficult
but manageable and I am quite happy with the results.

The number one health priority of 2024 for me will be to wage an
aggressive effort to deal with this fat. I plan to do a 14 day fast once
a quarter. In between I hope to lose about 10lbs of weight via ongoing
keto/carnivore diet with intermittent fasting. Fasting to lose fat
followed by eating in a way that gains fat is not the plan.

There is planning, and there is what the body does with your plans. That
acknowledged, it is within the realm of possibility that I could come
close to my goal weight over the next year. Losing weight in a healthy
way is the call of the hour. As is the urgency to get the fat off as
fast as is reasonable. To not do so is to accept that you have a part of
you spewing off all kinds of nasty things that harm your health.

In the photo on the left is where I go to the first time I traveled this
road. Lost 80lbs in a year and got fit. The right is the me at the start
of this journey. Highly diabetic, arthritic, and more. Becoming fit Lee
was in my forties, and I'm now entering the last year of my fifties. I
want to live my sixties as the guy on the left, fit and healthy Lee.

It is the time of New Year's resolutions - I look forward to hearing
your stories of healing and regaining abilities.

# Is Fasting Pain Relief Temporary?

One of the benefits I experienced in my 14 day water fast was great
relief in my osteoarthritis knees. In fact, it was like I had my old
knees back - no pain at all. It's day 5 after the fast and my normal
amount of pain has returned. Which naturally leads to the question - is
the pain relief of fasting worth it if it doesn't outlive the fast?

One thing is abundantly clear - I CAN feel pain free with my knees.
Whatever level of deterioration of the cartilage, whatever my current
level of arthritis pain - there is A way for my knees, as they are, to
have a pain free experience. Before we get to the question of how - we
should at least recognize "there could be a way". I lost weight, but not
THAT much for the weight to be the reason. Plus the pain came back when
only a few pounds of the weight had. It can't be that the cartilage
first fixed itself during the fast and then broke again after the fast.

The answer is in inflammation. My knees started feeling better when I
went on a very low carb/keto diet. Something about the fast took that
level of inflammation even further down. The answer to that is the
ketones. The pain relief and the resumption of pain correlate to when my
ketones hit into high gear on day 4, and came back down to normal on day
5. I'll link to a related article at the end. So, living the keto
lifestyle is certainly called for to keep the OA pain at lower levels.
Even so, I can't live in the deep ketosis that helped my knees so much
as that only happens during extended fasts.

The solution is to stop the causes of inflammation such that you don't
need as much "anti-inflammation". And we get back to the reason I am
targeting fat reduction. Too much fat, particularly visceral fat, and
the fat cells give of cytokines and other inflammatory molecules. The
fat is making you sick and keeping you in pain. It has to go and fasting
is a powerful tool have the body burn off that fat.

Yes, I absolutely believe that I have a future free of arthritis pain.
Fasting will be a fantastic tool. I get to experience the pain free
state for a few days, and I chip away at the fat that will relieve the
arthritis pain in two ways. The less heavy you are, the less load on
your knees and the better they will feel. The less over fat you are, the
less inflamed you will be. I've already gone from walking with a cane to
running a 5k. I live with much reduced pain, but that is not the same as
pain free. It was excruciating sitting on the floor wrapping presents -
then trying to get up off the floor. I have healed some, but have a long
way to go.

With fasting and a carnivore/keto diet and strength training, I believe
I will see further healing and improvement of my arthritic condition.

I was able to fit into my new Christmas sweater, which is a nice bonus
to the weight loss. Getting back to a size of clothes that doesn't need
a specially store is wonderful.
