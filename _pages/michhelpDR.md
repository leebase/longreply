# Financial Aid and Support Resources for a Low-Income Unmarried Mother in Michigan

A 30-year-old unmarried mother of two young children (4 months and 21 months) in Michigan can access a range of state/federal benefits, community support, and legal assistance. Below is a comprehensive overview of programs and resources, with details on eligibility, application processes, and recent changes or pilot initiatives.

## State & Federal Benefits

### Childcare Assistance

- **Michigan Child Development and Care (CDC) Program**: Michigan's childcare subsidy helps low-income parents afford childcare while they work or attend school.
  - **Eligibility**: Parent must have an approved need (employment, education, or medical leave) and income under program limits (approximately 185%â€“200% of poverty level, varying by family size)
  - As of Feb 2024, Michigan removed the requirement to cooperate with child support enforcement to qualify, making it easier for single parents to get aid
  - **How to apply**: Through the MI Bridges online portal or at a local MDHHS office. Applicants will need to verify income and work/school status. No fees are required; if approved, the state pays a portion of licensed childcare costs directly to the provider (families may owe a small copay based on income).

- **Head Start & Early Head Start**: These are free early education programs for low-income families that also provide childcare, health screenings, and meals.
  - Early Head Start serves infants and toddlers under age 3 (and pregnant mothers), while Head Start serves children 3â€“5
  - Given her children's ages (4 months and 21 months), Early Head Start can offer part-day or full-day care and developmental services
  - **Eligibility**: Household income generally under the federal poverty level or receiving public assistance (SNAP, TANF, etc.) makes a child eligible; being on Medicaid/SNAP already likely qualifies
  - **Application**: Contact the local Head Start agency or community action agency to apply (many have waitlists). She can find programs via the federal Head Start locator or by calling her county's Head Start office. Head Start programs are free; they may also help arrange transportation in some cases.

- **Great Start Readiness Program (GSRP)**: Although her children are still too young, be aware for the future: GSRP is Michigan's free preschool program for four-year-olds from low-income or "at-risk" families. Once her kids approach age 4, she can apply through local school districts or providers.

> ðŸ’¡ **Recent Pilot â€“ Tri-Share Childcare**: Michigan's MI Tri-Share program is a pilot that splits the cost of childcare between the state, employers, and employees. It's designed for working families who earn too much for CDC subsidy but still struggle with childcare costs. If she resumes work with a participating employer, this program could make daycare more affordable (each party pays 1/3 of the cost). She can check regional Tri-Share Hubs for employers in her area that offer this benefit. (Note: Because she's currently unemployed, Tri-Share would become relevant when she gains employment with a participating employer.)

### Housing Aid

- **Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher (HCV)**: This federal program helps very low-income families rent private housing by paying a portion of the rent.
  - **Eligibility**: Income typically must be below 50% of area median income (for example, under roughly $25,000â€“$35,000/year for a small family, depending on county). She must also pass background screening and have at least one U.S. citizen or eligible immigrant in the household (her children born in the U.S. qualify).
  - **How to apply**: In Michigan, vouchers are administered by local Public Housing Agencies or the Michigan State Housing Development Authority (MSHDA). She should apply to any open Section 8 waitlists in her county or nearby counties. (As of now, MSHDA's central waitlist opens periodically by county; many local housing commissions have their own waitlists.)
  - Wait times can be long (months or years) due to high demand. If accepted, the voucher will cover the portion of rent that exceeds roughly 30% of her income, for an approved housing unit that meets safety standards.
  - Applications are free and usually done online or via the housing agency's office.
  - **Tip**: Since waitlists may be closed, check regularly or sign up for notifications. In the meantime, she can also inquire about Project-Based Section 8 units (apartments that have rent subsidies attached to them) â€“ some of those waitlists might open sooner.

- **Public Housing**: Local public housing developments offer income-based rent (generally 30% of income). These are managed by city or county housing authorities.
  - **Eligibility**: Similar income limits as Section 8.
  - **Application**: Contact the local public housing authority for an application; each development often has its own waitlist.
  - Because she has two children, she could request a two- or three-bedroom unit. Rent would be adjusted to her income (if she has zero income, rent could be as low as $0 to $50/month minimum).

- **Emergency Rent and Homeless Assistance**: If she faces eviction or homelessness, Michigan's State Emergency Relief (SER) program can provide one-time help with rent or security deposits to prevent eviction.
  - **Eligibility**: She must have an emergency (e.g. an eviction notice or homeless situation) and meet income/assets tests (asset limit ~$15,000, excluding one car and primary home).
  - **Application**: Submit an SER application via MI Bridges or at the local MDHHS office, marking "Emergency Shelter/Housing" need. Decisions are fast (usually within 10 days due to the emergency nature).
  - If approved, SER can cover back rent or a deposit up to certain caps (she may need to pay part of the cost as a copay depending on income).
  - In addition, MSHDA's Housing Assessment and Resource Agencies (HARAs) in each community coordinate homelessness prevention. Each county HARA can assess her situation and connect her to available grants or shelter resources.
  - **How to connect**: She should call 2-1-1 or her local HARA (find via the MSHDA website or 211) if she is in a housing crisis. HARA may have access to Emergency Solutions Grants, short-term rental assistance, or rapid re-housing programs.

- **Rental Assistance Programs**: Beyond federal programs, there may be state or local rental aid. For example, some counties offer temporary COVID-19 rent relief funds or church-based assistance for rent. The Salvation Army, St. Vincent de Paul, or United Way sometimes have emergency funds for families who can't pay rent. These are often one-time and require an urgent need (like a court summons or shut-off notice). She can find these by calling 2-1-1, which maintains a database of local rental assistance programs.

- **Housing Counseling & Tenant Rights**: If she needs guidance on tenant rights or finding housing, organizations like Michigan 2-1-1 or Legal Aid can advise. Michigan also has a Legal Assistance Center in many courts for eviction defense. Since affordable housing is competitive, it may help to get on multiple waitlists and consider any subsidized housing openings (even in neighboring towns).

### Food & Nutrition Programs

- **SNAP (Food Stamps)**: She is already on SNAP, which provides a monthly food benefit on a Michigan Bridge Card. She should ensure her household composition (herself, kids, and if her partner shares food expenses, him as well) and income are updated in her case to maximize the benefit.
  - Michigan SNAP also has programs like Double Up Food Bucks that allow her to double her SNAP dollars at participating farmers markets and grocery stores for fresh produce (e.g., spend $10 SNAP and get $10 extra for fruits/veggies). This can stretch her food budget further.
  - **Application/Management**: Continue using MI Bridges to report any changes (e.g., if she starts earning income, etc.).
  - **Note**: With two young children and no income, she likely receives a high SNAP amount; if not, she can contact her MDHHS caseworker for a review.

- **WIC (Women, Infants, and Children)**: WIC is a critical nutrition program specifically for pregnant/postpartum women, infants, and children under 5. It provides free nutritious foods (formula, baby food, cereal, milk, eggs, etc.), nutrition education, and breastfeeding support. Given she has a 4-month-old and a 21-month-old, she definitely should be on WIC.
  - **Eligibility**: Income up to 185% of poverty (for instance, a family of 4 can earn up to ~$55,500/year), but families on Medicaid or SNAP are automatically income-eligible. She meets the categorical requirement as a postpartum mother and caretaker of young children.
  - **How to apply**: Contact the local WIC clinic (often through the county health department or community health center). The application involves providing proof of identity, address, and income (but showing a Medicaid or SNAP approval letter suffices as proof of income eligibility).
  - At the WIC appointment, a health screening is done for her and the kids (they check height, weight, iron levels, etc.). She'll receive an EBT card (the WIC Bridge Card) to purchase specific foods each month.
  - WIC also provides free formula for infants (not full needs, but a significant amount), baby cereal and baby foods when the child is older than 6 months, and things like breastfeeding supplies if needed. There is no cost to participate.
  - **Additional benefit**: WIC participants get referrals to other resources and Project FRESH farmers' market coupons in summer for additional fruits/veggies.

- **Food Pantries and Food Banks**: In addition to SNAP and WIC, local food pantries can supplement her food needs. Many churches, community centers, and food banks in Michigan distribute free groceries, including diapers or toiletries at times. She can call 2-1-1 or visit mi211.org to get listings of nearby food pantries and free meal programs.
  - Larger regional food banks (like Gleaners in SE Michigan, Forgotten Harvest, or the Food Bank of Eastern Michigan) have networks of pantry partners and often run mobile food pantry events with fresh food.
  - These typically don't require extensive proof of eligibility â€“ usually just an ID and signing a form that you meet income guidelines (self-declared). Given her limited income, she would qualify.

- **School Meal Programs**: When her children reach school age or even preschool, remember that they can receive free meals at school. Many Michigan schools offer free breakfast and lunch to all students in high-need districts or via application based on income. For now, if her older toddler enrolls in Early Head Start or any daycare, ensure they are aware of her eligibility for free meals through the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) which provides food in childcare settings.

- **WIC Farmers Market Nutrition & Double Up**: Through WIC, she'll get Project FRESH coupons in the summer (for fresh produce at farmers markets). Additionally, with her SNAP EBT card, she can use Double Up Food Bucks at participating markets and some grocery stores statewide to get extra fruits and vegetables â€“ effectively doubling the value of her SNAP for produce up to $20/day. This is a lesser-known benefit that can significantly help with healthy food for the kids.

- **Prepared Meals and Miscellaneous**: If she ever struggles to cook (for example, overwhelmed with infant care), there are soup kitchens and community meal sites where she can get hot meals for herself and the family. Local charities and churches (Salvation Army kitchens, community dinners) often serve free meals â€“ 2-1-1 can direct her to these. Additionally, Summer Food Service Program sites in Michigan provide free meals to children under 18 during summer months; even toddlers can receive those if a parent brings them to a site (like a library or park).

### Cash Assistance and Income Support

- **TANF â€“ Family Independence Program (FIP)**: Michigan's TANF cash assistance program is called FIP. This provides a biweekly or monthly cash grant to very low-income families with minor children to help with basic needs.
  - **Eligibility**: As an unemployed parent of two young children, she can likely qualify if her assets are low (under $15,000, excluding one vehicle and home) and household income is minimal. If her partner's income is zero or very low, they can apply as a two-parent household (even unmarried, as long as paternity for the children is acknowledged, both parents can be on the case). They must be caring for at least one child in the home (which they are).
  - **Work requirements**: FIP requires adult recipients to engage in work-related activities through the PATH program (unless the children are very young â€“ Michigan may defer work requirements for a parent with an infant under 12 months, known as a "child under one" exemption). She should ask about this exemption, since her 4-month-old likely qualifies her to postpone work program participation for now.
  - If she does participate, the PATH (Partnership. Accountability. Training. Hope.) program will help with job search or training and can provide childcare and transportation assistance while she completes the program.
  - **Benefit amount**: FIP benefits aren't large â€“ roughly $492 per month for a family of three with no income (and about $720/month for a family of four). (These figures can change slightly; and if her partner is included, it might count as a family of 4.)
  - Note Michigan just expanded the lifetime limit from 48 months to 60 months (5 years) effective April 2025, so she could potentially receive FIP longer if needed.
  - **How to apply**: Use MI Bridges online to apply for "Cash Assistance (FIP)" or apply at the MDHHS office. The application will require IDs, birth certificates for kids, proof of address, and any income information. Once approved, funds are loaded onto the Michigan Bridge Card (the same card as SNAP) or issued via direct deposit.

- **Note**: Since she is unmarried, if the father (partner) is in the home and acknowledged as the dad, he will be part of the assistance unit. Michigan will typically require that she cooperate with child support enforcement unless they are living together and already caring for the children jointly.
  - Normally, to get FIP, a single mother must help the state establish paternity and a child support order for the absent parent. In her case, the father is present, but because they're not married, they should ensure paternity is legally established (see Legal section).
  - If he's in the home, the state won't pursue child support against him (since he's not "absent"), but if he were out of the home, she'd have to cooperate with child support or request a good cause waiver.
  - It's good to know that for childcare assistance (CDC), Michigan no longer mandates cooperation with child support, but for cash assistance the requirement still generally exists for absent parents.

- **State Emergency Relief (SER)**: Aside from housing emergencies mentioned, SER also provides utility bill assistance and other emergency aid. For example, if her electricity or heat is at risk of shutoff, or if she needs a repair to her furnace or a broken appliance, SER can help.
  - **Utilities**: Michigan's SER (with federal LIHEAP funds) can pay past-due amounts or deliver fuel (propane, etc.) to avoid shutoff, usually once per season. She'd apply through MI Bridges indicating "energy assistance" as the need. Typically, she must have a shutoff notice or already be shut off to qualify, and there may be a required copay depending on income.
  - There's also a Home Heating Credit in Michigan (a separate program through the Department of Treasury) that she should apply for annually â€“ it provides a one-time check to help with heating costs, based on income and heating expenses. Since she has almost no income, the Home Heating Credit could be a few hundred dollars â€“ the form is MI-1040CR-7, due around September each year. It's not required to owe taxes to get it; it's essentially an energy grant. Many who get FIP or SER automatically are considered for it, but she can also apply via a simple tax form.

- **Water Assistance**: Michigan has a newer Low-Income Household Water Assistance Program (LIHWAP) and some local water bill aid (especially in Detroit/Flint and other cities). If she pays for water, she might inquire through MDHHS or 2-1-1 about water bill help (some areas have an application via MI Bridges for water assistance as well).

- **Weatherization**: Through MDHHS and local Community Action Agencies, the Weatherization Assistance Program offers free home energy improvements (insulation, furnace tune-ups, etc.) for low-income households. If she rents, the landlord's permission is needed, but it can still be done. This can lower utility bills in the long run. She can apply via the Community Action Agency serving her county.

- **MI Bridges Benefits**: Since she is already using MI Bridges for Medicaid/SNAP, she can use the MI Bridges portal not only to apply for benefits but also to search for local resources. MI Bridges has a section where users can find community programs (food banks, job training, etc.) by entering their ZIP code. This is a newer feature that might help her discover local charities as well.

- **Tax Credits for Families**: Even with no current income, she should be aware of tax credits that can put cash in her pocket when she or her partner file

## Tax Credits for Families (continued)

- **Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)**: A refundable credit for low-income working individuals and families. If either she or her partner had any earnings in the tax year, they should file a tax return to claim the federal EITC.
  - For example, if in a future year she earns some income from a part-time job, with two children she could get a sizable refund (federal EITC for 2 children can be up to ~$6,800 at certain income levels).
  - **Michigan EITC (Working Families Tax Credit)**: Michigan has its own EITC equal to 30% of the federal credit (recently increased from 6% as of tax year 2022). This means if she qualifies for say $3,000 federal EITC, Michigan would give an extra $900.
  - Both federal and state EITC are refundable, meaning she gets the money even if she had little or no tax withholding.
  - **Eligibility**: Must have earned income (wages or self-employment); for example, if her partner worked at all in 2023, they should file jointly or separately to claim EITC based on that income.
  - There are income limits (which are relatively high for EITC; e.g. nearly $50k for a single with 2 kids, around $55k married).
  - If they had no earnings at all in a year, they can't get EITC for that year, but keep this in mind for the future when she returns to work.
  - Free tax filing help is available through VITA sites for low-income people to ensure they claim these credits.

- **Child Tax Credit (CTC)**: A federal tax credit of up to $2,000 for each child under 17. In 2023 and 2024, up to $1,600 of that per child can be received as a refund (the Additional CTC) if the filer has at least $2,500 in earnings.
  - Since she currently has no earnings, she might not benefit from CTC for this tax year unless her partner has income.
  - If one of them works even part of the year, they should claim the CTC for both kids on their tax return. The credit phases in with earnings (15% of income over $2,500).
  - **Note**: The American Rescue Plan's expanded CTC (which gave $3,600 per baby in 2021 even with no income) has expired â€“ now the rules reverted to requiring some earnings. But if she or her partner earn a little, it's worth filing taxes to get whatever portion of the CTC they qualify for.

- **Michigan Homestead Property Tax Credit**: If she rents or pays property tax, Michigan offers a refundable credit to offset housing costs. Renters can claim 23% of rent as "property tax" and get a portion back if it's high relative to income.
  - Given her income is extremely low, she might qualify for a significant Homestead Credit refund.
  - Example: If she paid $600/month in rent ($7,200/year), 23% of that is about $1,656. The credit is a percentage of the amount by which that exceeds 3.2% of her income. With near-zero income, she could see much of that $1,656 as a refund (subject to max credit limits).
  - **How to claim**: File Michigan tax form MI-1040CR. Even if she had no taxable income, she can file this form for a refund. (Maximum income to get this credit is quite high, ~$63,000, so she definitely qualifies.)
  - If she hasn't filed, she can go back up to four years to claim past credits.

- **Other Tax Benefits**: If she ever pays for childcare (when she returns to work), the IRS Child and Dependent Care Credit could reimburse some of those expenses in her tax refund. Also, since she's unmarried, whichever parent has income and custody can consider filing as Head of Household (for better tax rates) and claiming the kids. This gets complex, but a free tax prep counselor can advise them. For now, the key is any work income should be leveraged to claim these refundable credits.

## Michigan-Specific Health and Family Programs

- **Medicaid & Health Coverage**: She is on Medicaid, which provides free health coverage for herself and the children. Michigan expanded Medicaid (Healthy Michigan Plan) for adults up to 138% FPL, so even her partner might qualify for health coverage if he isn't already enrolled (childless adults or parents can get Healthy Michigan if income is low). She should ensure the kids are enrolled in MIChild/Medicaid as well (they likely are, since she mentioned Medicaid).
  - **Postpartum Coverage**: Michigan now provides 12 months of continuous Medicaid postpartum coverage to women who were on Medicaid while pregnant. This means since she recently gave birth, she'll stay covered for a full year after delivery regardless of small changes in income.
  - This extended coverage (part of the Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies initiative) ensures she can access checkups, contraceptives, and mental health care during the critical postpartum period.
  - After 12 months, she can still keep Medicaid if her income remains low or transition to Healthy Michigan Plan.
  - **Note**: Make sure to complete Medicaid renewals on time (the state is resuming annual renewals after the pandemic pause).

- **Maternal Infant Health Program (MIHP)**: MIHP is a free home visiting program for Medicaid-eligible pregnant women and infants up to age 1 in Michigan.
  - It provides in-home support from nurses and social workers to help with parenting education, postpartum adjustment, safe sleep, infant care, and connects families to resources like cribs, car seats, and counseling.
  - Since she is on Medicaid and has an infant, she qualifies automatically.
  - **How to enroll**: Often the hospital or her OB/midwife might have referred her after birth, but if not, she can call her local health department or ask her Medicaid health plan to enroll her in MIHP. A nurse would then schedule home (or virtual) visits, maybe 1â€“2 times a month.
  - **Benefits**: MIHP can help with things like breastfeeding support, addressing depression or stress, providing referrals for housing/food, and even transportation to medical appointments. It's tailored to the family's needs and completely free. Many moms find it reassuring to have a professional to consult during their baby's first year.

- **Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies Programs**: In some Michigan communities, there are additional support programs for new mothers â€“ e.g. the Nurse-Family Partnership (an evidence-based nurse home visiting program for first-time low-income moms), or Early Head Start home-based services (where a home visitor helps with child development activities). She can inquire via 2-1-1 or her local Great Start Collaborative about any such programs. These often provide not only guidance but sometimes free baby items or incentives for participation.

- **MI Bridges Community Partners**: When logged into MI Bridges, she can look at "Explore Resources" for things like help with cribs (many health departments have a Safe Sleep program that gives free Pack 'n Plays to families who need a safe crib) or car seat safety programs (some fire departments or hospitals give free car seats to low-income parents who attend a safety class). These are smaller benefits but important for child safety and can save money.

- **Michigan 2-1-1**: It's worth emphasizing that 2-1-1 (United Way) in Michigan is a free helpline available 24/7 that can connect her with any kind of assistance. For example, if she needs formula during a WIC delay, or a free stroller, or holiday gifts for her kids, 2-1-1 will know if there's a local drive or charity providing that. She can dial 2-1-1 or use the website to search by her location. This is a quick way to find Michigan-specific benefits like local scholarships for parents, county relief funds, or special initiatives (e.g., some counties have a one-time "Children's Special Needs" fund or a diaper distribution program run by the county).

## Nonprofit & Community Resources

Beyond government assistance, numerous nonprofit, faith-based, and community organizations in Michigan provide material aid and support for single mothers and low-income families. Here are some key resources:

### Basic Needs Assistance (Charities & Churches)

- **United Way and 2-1-1 Network**: United Way's 2-1-1 is a clearinghouse for local charity programs. By calling 2-1-1, she can get referrals for things like emergency financial help, free or low-cost childcare, or household items.
  - For example, if she needs help paying a utility bill that SER didn't cover fully, 2-1-1 might refer her to The Heat and Warmth Fund (THAW) or Salvation Army's assistance programs.
  - Many Salvation Army corps in Michigan offer one-time utility assistance, rent help, or case management for families in need.
  - Likewise, St. Vincent de Paul (Catholic charity) can sometimes help with rent, furniture, or bills on a case-by-case basis.
  - Love In the Name of Christ (Love INC) affiliates (in some counties) coordinate church-based help for needs like car repairs, clothes, or mentoring.

- **Food, Clothing, Household Goods**: In addition to food pantries, there are clothing closets and furniture banks. For instance, the Grace Centers of Hope or Goodwill might provide clothing vouchers. Some churches run "free stores" where families can get used clothing and housewares at no cost. Baby closets are often found at churches (more on that below). If she needs furnishings (crib, beds, etc.), organizations like Furniture Bank of Southeastern Michigan serve some areas, and Salvation Army thrift stores can sometimes provide a voucher for free items if referred by a caseworker. 2-1-1 would know the nearest resources for these needs.

- **Diaper Banks and Baby Supplies**: Diapers and formula can be expensive, and she already gets some formula from WIC, but likely not enough diapers from any government program. Fortunately, Michigan has several diaper banks and charitable programs:
  - The National Diaper Bank Network lists member agencies in Michigan where low-income parents can get free diapers regularly. Examples: The Detroit Area Diaper Bank, Greater Lansing diaper bank, etc., distribute diapers through partner pantries. She can ask her WIC clinic or 2-1-1 for the nearest diaper distribution site.
  - Many Catholic Charities offices have "baby pantries." For example, Catholic Charities West Michigan runs Baby and Toddler Pantry (often called St. Gianna's Baby Pantry) that provides diapers, wipes, formula, baby food, clothing and more to anyone in need. In southeast Michigan, Catholic Charities Project Hope has baby closets with similar supplies. These usually require an appointment but no fees, just proof of parenthood of the child (like a birth certificate or Medicaid card for the child).
  - "Mom and baby" support charities: There are pregnancy resource centers (PRCs) that, aside from counseling, often give out free diapers and formula. (E.g., Heartbeat of Monroe, Pregnancy Aid Detroit, etc.) While PRCs have a religious/anti-abortion aspect, many do offer material assistance regardless of the mother's situation. She can choose to utilize them if comfortable.
  - Community Action Agencies: Some CAAs in Michigan have funds for baby needs or can refer to local drives. For instance, a local Early Head Start program sometimes has extra diapers or connections to giveaways.
  - Hospital social workers: Since her baby is 4 months, if she delivered at a hospital, the social work department may have enrolled her in a program or can still help postpartum â€“ some hospitals have free diaper programs for patients who delivered there.
  - Encourage her to ask at pediatrician visits â€“ many pediatric offices know of resources or even have samples (diapers, formula) to give to families in need.
  - **Application/Process**: Most diaper banks do not have a complicated application; usually she would provide basic info (name, zip code, child's age) and they give a supply (often a fixed number of diapers per month). For example, one might give 50 diapers per child per month. It's important to reach out to multiple sources if one alone isn't sufficient.

- **Free or Low-Cost Transportation**: Without a driver's license for her partner, transportation is a challenge. Michigan has a patchwork of programs to help low-income individuals get around:
  - **Medicaid Transportation**: Since she's on Medicaid, she is entitled to Non-Emergency Medical Transportation (NEMT) for health appointments. This means she can call her Medicaid health plan to schedule free rides (or get gas reimbursement) for doctor visits, WIC appointments, etc. It won't cover non-medical trips, but it ensures she and the kids can get to healthcare visits.
  - **Local Transit Programs**: Many counties offer reduced fare bus passes for low-income riders. For example, DDOT (Detroit) and TheRide (Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti) have programs where those on public assistance ride at discount or free certain days. She should check with her city's public transit office. Some areas have dial-a-ride services that pick up disabled or low-income residents; if she has trouble lugging two kids on a bus, a door-to-door service might help (though often these require a small fee).
  - **Car Donation/Repair Programs**: A few nonprofits focus on helping families get a car:
    - Goodwill's "Workers on Wheels" (in some regions like West Michigan or UP) refurbishes donated cars and provides them to low-income workers who need transportation. These programs typically require the person to be working or have a job offer, and able to pay title/insurance, etc. If she plans to work, this is something to keep in mind and inquire about in her area.
    - Friends In Deed (Washtenaw County): They offer transportation assistance, including car repair grants and even providing used cars to families without one, to enable them to get to work. If she lives in or near that county, that's a resource.
    - Mother Waddles Car Donation Program (Detroit): This is a well-known car donation charity. People donate cars and they're either given to needy families or sold to fund programs. She could reach out to see if they have any direct car placement program for clients.
  - **Workforce Agency Programs**: Michigan Works! in some regions has programs to assist with car repairs or bus passes for those seeking employment. For example, there have been pilot programs providing ride-share credits or gas cards for job seekers. When she engages with Michigan Works or PATH, she should ask about help with transportation â€“ it's often part of their supportive services.
  - **Subsidized Uber/Taxi Programs**: In a few urban areas, nonprofits partner with Lyft/Uber to provide free rides for things like job interviews or grocery trips for those in need. For example, the Detroit at Work initiative at one point had free Lyft rides for training program participants. While not guaranteed, it's worth asking case managers or 2-1-1 if any such program is active.
  - **Church volunteer networks**: Some churches (often through St. Vincent de Paul or similar) have volunteers who might give rides to single moms for appointments or errands if asked. If she has a church community, she could inquire.

In summary, while there is no single "free car" program widely available, tapping into the mosaic of local help (buses, Medicaid rides, nonprofits) can meet her transportation needs incrementally. Also, resolving her partner's license issue (see Legal section) will be key to long-term independence, since that will enable him to drive legally again.

- **Community Centers & Family Resource Programs**: Many communities in Michigan have family resource centers, often run by school districts or nonprofits, that host parent support workshops, playgroups for kids, and provide referrals. For example, Michigan Great Start Collaboratives in each county have Great Start Parent Coalitions â€“ these are groups of parents (often including single moms) that meet, share resources, and sometimes distribute free items (like children's books, school readiness kits, etc.). She can find her local Great Start Collaborative via the Intermediate School District or the Great Start to Quality website. Joining a parent coalition or attending free playgroups can reduce isolation and connect her to more support (some even offer free diapers to participants courtesy of grants).

- **Churches and Faith-based Aid**: Beyond formal programs, simply reaching out to local churches, synagogues, or mosques can yield help. Many religious congregations have a benevolence fund for community members in crisis (like money for a heating bill or groceries). They also might pair her with a mentor or a "mom's group." For instance, the MOPS (Mothers of Preschoolers) groups (which meet at churches around the country) welcome moms of young kids for mutual support â€“ some have childcare during meetings so moms get a break, and it's not required to be a church member to join. This can provide emotional support and sometimes material help (MOPS groups often do meal trains for new babies or help with baby supplies).

- **Holiday and Seasonal Assistance**: As her children grow, she should be aware of seasonal charitable programs. For example, Toys for Tots, Angel Tree, or local "adopt-a-family" programs can provide Christmas gifts for the children. Coats for Kids drives (often by

- **Holiday and Seasonal Assistance** (continued): Coats for Kids drives (often by Rotary or Salvation Army) ensure the little ones have winter gear. Back-to-School drives can supply backpacks and clothes when the time comes. Registration for these typically happens a month or two in advance of the season (e.g., sign up in October for holiday toys). 2-1-1 or MDHHS offices usually have flyers about these programs each year.

### Emotional Support & Counseling Resources

- **Support Groups for Mothers**: Being an unmarried mom can be isolating, but there are support networks:
  - **Single Mom Support Groups**: Some nonprofits host support groups specifically for single or young mothers. For example, the Single Mom's Connection (an initiative in some parts of Michigan) lists support resources and might host virtual meet-ups. She can search Facebook for groups like "Michigan Single Moms" or her city's name + "mom group." Many communities have Facebook groups where parents trade advice and even give away kids' items. While not formal, these can be very helpful (and free).
  - **Postpartum Support**: If she's experiencing postpartum depression or anxiety (common in the first year), she should know she's not alone and help is available. Postpartum Support International (PSI) has a Michigan chapter and a helpline. They can connect her with local postpartum depression groups or free phone consultations. Also, some hospitals run "Mom to Mom" support groups for new mothers (check with the hospital where she delivered or nearby hospitals). These might be open to all new moms in the community and are a chance to share experiences and coping strategies.
  - **Early Childhood Family Classes**: Programs like Parents as Teachers or local library story times provide social outlets. Libraries often have baby story hours where she can meet other parents (and maybe find kindred spirits who might do babysitting swaps or carpooling).

- **Counseling Services**: If she wants one-on-one counseling but can't afford private therapy, she has options:
  - Because she has Medicaid, she can access mental health services. For mild to moderate issues, her Medicaid Health Plan should cover therapy (she can call the member services number and ask for a list of in-network therapists, including ones who offer teletherapy which could be easier with kids at home).
  - For more significant mental health needs (e.g., severe depression, trauma, substance use), each county's Community Mental Health (CMH) agency provides services to Medicaid recipients and the uninsured. CMH can offer counseling, psychiatric services, and in some cases in-home family therapy. She can self-refer by calling the local CMH access line and requesting an intake.
  - **Nonprofits and sliding-scale clinics**: Organizations like Catholic Charities and Lutheran Social Services often have counseling programs on a sliding fee scale (and they typically take Medicaid too). There are also university psychology clinics (if there's a university nearby, their graduate psychology or social work program might have a free/low-cost clinic for community members).
  - Michigan 211 can provide contacts for counseling centers that offer free services to low-income clients. For instance, in some areas, Corner Health Center (for young parents) or Jewish Family Services (open to all, not just Jewish clients) provide mental health counseling subsidized by grants.

- **Domestic Violence and Family Support**: If her situation with her partner ever becomes unsafe or stressful, remember that domestic violence shelters and agencies (like SafeHouse, Haven, etc.) not only shelter victims but also provide counseling, legal advocacy, and support groups for women under stress â€“ even if she's not in immediate danger, they have programs for healthy relationships, parenting under stress, etc.

- **Family Counseling / Parenting Programs**: For strengthening the family unit, she can look into free parenting classes or couples counseling:
  - Michigan State University Extension offers workshops on parenting, budgeting, nutrition (often free for those on WIC/SNAP). These can increase her skills and confidence.
  - **Fatherhood programs**: If her partner wants to improve his parenting or coparenting skills, there are fatherhood initiatives (e.g., Detroit Fatherhood Initiative or local "24/7 Dad" classes) that sometimes come with incentives like gift cards, diapers, or assistance with employment.
  - **Relationship counseling**: Some community organizations (and faith groups) run free or low-cost relationship education classes for unmarried parents. The goal is to help them communicate and co-parent effectively. If they are interested, they might find such classes through CMH or agencies like Healthy Marriage/Responsible Fatherhood grant programs that exist in some Michigan communities.

Remember, her mental health is as important as material needs. If she ever feels overwhelmed, she can call hotlines like the Maternal Mental Health Hotline (1-833-943-5746) or even 988 (mental health crisis line) if in emotional crisis. There are trained counselors available 24/7 to talk, and it's free.

## Workforce & Training Opportunities

While caring for two infants is a full-time job in itself, she may be considering future employment or training once childcare becomes feasible. Michigan offers programs to help her prepare for and find work when she's ready, often with accommodations for parents:

- **Michigan Works! and PATH**: The statewide Michigan Works! agencies provide free career services to unemployed or underemployed residents.
  - She can visit a Michigan Works! One-Stop Center to meet with a career coach.
  - **Services available**: job search assistance, resume workshops, job postings, and importantly job training funds.
  - Through federal programs (Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act â€“ WIOA), she might qualify for tuition-free training in high-demand fields (healthcare, IT, trades, etc.).
  - For example, Michigan Works can pay for a Certified Nursing Assistant course or a web design course if it aligns with job opportunities. They may also cover supportive services like transportation or childcare while in training.
  - If she enrolls in FIP cash assistance, the PATH program will directly connect her with Michigan Works! and could fund things like short-term certifications or even community college classes, along with childcare assistance while she attends.
  - One single mom in Michigan reported Michigan Works helped with tuition, books, and mileage for nursing school, showing what's possible.
  - **How to engage**: She can reach out now to Michigan Works! (find the nearest office via michiganworks.org) even if she's not ready to start, just to learn about options. There is no cost to use their services.

- **Adult Education & GED**: If she hasn't finished high school or wants to boost basic skills, there are free adult education classes and GED prep programs in most communities (often through local school districts or community colleges). Also, literacy programs and community colleges have tutors to help improve reading, math, or even offer ESL if needed. Achieving educational milestones can increase her earning potential long-term.

- **Community College and Scholarships**: If she's interested in college or a technical degree, Michigan has various grants. For instance:
  - **Pell Grants**: Federal grants for low-income students can cover a large portion of community college tuition. As a mother of two with no income, she'd likely qualify for the maximum Pell Grant (over $7,000/year). Filling out the FAFSA is the first step (it's free, at studentaid.gov).
  - **Michigan Reconnect and Futures for Frontliners**: Michigan Reconnect offers free in-district community college tuition for residents 25+ who don't have a college degree. She is 30, so this could give her free tuition at a local community college or trade school. Although she's not working now, Reconnect has no income requirement, just age and educational background requirements. Futures for Frontliners was a similar program for those who worked in essential jobs during COVID â€“ if her partner did, he might qualify.
  - **Scholarships for Single Moms**: There are specific scholarships for mothers. For example, the Patsy Takemoto Mink Foundation offers grants (around $5,000) to low-income mothers pursuing education. The Women's Independence Scholarship Program (WISP) helps survivors of domestic violence with education costs. Local clubs (like Rotary, PEO, or community foundations) often have scholarships for "non-traditional students" or single parents. She can search databases like FastWeb or ask a college financial aid office about such scholarships.
  - **Tuition Incentive Program (TIP)**: If she was ever on Medicaid from age 9â€“18, Michigan's TIP could pay for her associate degree tuition. She should check if she's eligible by calling the Student Scholarships office, because many low-income young adults don't realize they have this funding available.

- **Job Training Programs (Short-term)**: If she prefers quick entry to employment, there are short-term training programs (4-12 weeks) in fields like CNA (Certified Nurse Aide), CDL truck driving, medical billing, welding, etc., often free through Michigan Works or community colleges. Some programs are designed for women to enter non-traditional careers (like Women in Construction programs). Also, apprenticeships in skilled trades allow you to earn while you learn â€“ for example, she could become an apprentice electrician or plumber with no prior experience. The apprenticeship route provides a paycheck from day one and training costs are usually covered by the employer or union.

- **Remote and Flexible Work**: Given childcare costs, working from home might be attractive once she's ready. Remote jobs in customer service, data entry, virtual assisting, or transcription could allow her to earn income without transportation or full-time childcare. She should be cautious of scams, but many legitimate companies hire remote workers in Michigan (especially since the pandemic expanded remote work). Websites like Michigan Works! "Back to Work" listings, Indeed, or Upwork can be sources of remote opportunities. She could start with part-time gigs during nap times. Additionally, Michigan Rehabilitation Services sometimes helps individuals start home-based micro-enterprises if they face barriers to traditional employment (even if not "disabled," they might have programs for caretakers).

- **Childcare Support for Working Parents**: When she does start working, apart from the CDC subsidy mentioned earlier, she should remember:
  - If she finds a job, she can immediately apply for CDC childcare assistance (she doesn't have to wait; having a job offer or new employment is an approved reason). With her low income, she'd likely qualify and may have no copay for childcare if her income is below 100% FPL. That means the state could pay the full cost of an approved daycare or licensed home provider for her kids while she works.
  - Some employers offer childcare benefits. For instance, large hospitals or universities in Michigan have on-site daycare with sliding fees or priority placement for employees. A few companies also give a childcare stipend. It's worth looking into such employers when she's job searching.

- **The Earned Income Disregard for DHS benefits**: When she transitions to work, certain benefits won't cut off immediately. For example, if on FIP, Michigan disregards some income for a few months, and even after that, FIP only tapers off gradually. Medicaid typically continues for a year minimum after earnings rise (Transitional Medicaid). And as discussed, childcare and EITC will kick in to support the transition. So working doesn't mean she loses all support right away; the system is designed to avoid the "cliff effect" as much as possible.

- **Resume and Interview Prep**: Nonprofits like Dress for Success (in Detroit and Grand Rapids) can provide professional attire for interviews and career coaching to women re-entering the workforce. Michigan Works centers also often host job fairs and hiring events â€“ she can attend those to connect directly with employers when ready. Given her gap due to childcare, she might consider doing a short volunteer or internship stint (even 5 hours a week) at a local nonprofit or library, to have recent experience on her resume and references â€“ plus some programs like AmeriCorps VISTA provide a stipend and childcare allowance for volunteers (that's a more intense commitment though).

- **Childcare During Training**: If she enrolls in an approved training or education program (through Michigan Works or a college while on FIP), that typically counts as an approved need for childcare subsidy. Also, certain training programs (like some vocational rehab programs or TANF-funded programs) have on-site childcare or partner with daycare providers. She should always ask about childcare help when signing up for any program.

- **Networking with Other Moms**: Interestingly, other mothers can be a gateway to jobs as well. For example, a mom group might know of a flexible babysitting job or a work-from-home customer service job one of them does. Building those community connections can lead to leads (e.g., "my company is hiring remote data entry clerks, I can refer you").

In summary, when she's ready to think about working or studying, Michigan has many supports to train and place her, and help with childcare and costs along the way. The key is to use agencies like Michigan Works! and community colleges, which have funding precisely to help people in her situation gain skills and become self-sufficient. There are success stories of single moms in Michigan leveraging these programs to get nursing degrees, IT certifications, etc., often at no cost to them. With careful planning, she can do the same in due course.

## Legal & Family Rights

Understanding her legal rights and accessing legal aid can help stabilize her family's situation, especially regarding her partner's driver's license and their rights as unmarried parents.

### Parental Rights for Unmarried Parents in Michigan

- **Establishing Paternity**: Because they are not married, the father (her partner) is not automatically the legal father of the children until paternity is established. If they haven't done so already, it's important to establish paternity for the father to have legal rights and for the children to be eligible for certain benefits (like the father's health insurance, Social Security, etc., if applicable).
  - The simplest way is if both parents signed an Affidavit of Parentage at the hospital or afterward. This is a form that legally names him as the father and is filed with the state.
  - If they did sign it for each child, then paternity is legally established (his name should be on the birth certificates). If not, they can still sign one now (it needs to be notarized and sent to Michigan Vital Records) or establish paternity through the court.
  - There is no cost to file an Affidavit at birth; later there might be a small fee to file it. They can contact the local county registrar or DHS for help. Establishing paternity does not require going to court if both agree.

- **Custody and Decision-Making**: In Michigan, when parents are unmarried and there is no court order, the mother has initial custody by default. This means legally she has sole authority to make decisions for the children until a court says otherwise.
  - Even if the father's name is on the birth certificate, without a court order the mother is considered the custodial parent. This is important to know in case of any disagreement or if, say, she needed to move â€“ she wouldn't need anyone's permission to move with the children (though it's considerate to discuss as a family).
  - However, since they are together and co-parenting, they might not feel the need for a formal custody order. If their relationship is stable, they can continue as is. But if there were ever a split or conflict, either of them could file in court to get a custody/parenting time order.
  - **Unmarried fathers' rights**: Once paternity is established, the father has the right to seek custody or visitation through the court. Michigan courts decide custody based on the best interests of the child (looking at factors like bonding, ability to provide, etc.). If he's a good, involved dad, he can get joint custody or at least ample parenting time.
  - For now, since they reside together, this is not a pressing issue. They should just both be aware that if something happened (e.g., a disagreement leading to separation), the mother legally holds the cards until a court order might change that. It might be wise for them to discuss and have a shared understanding, maybe even a simple written plan, about caring for the kids if one of them had to be away.

- **Child Support**: Typically, if parents separate, the court would order the non-custodial parent to pay child support. In their case, they share finances and the kids, so no support order exists.
  - If she applies for certain benefits like TANF (FIP), the state might pursue a child support order against the father (because the state wants fathers to financially contribute instead of the state). However, if he's in the home and they present themselves as a unit, MDHHS might not pursue support since he's not "absent."
  - If she ever encounters a requirement to "cooperate with child support" in benefit applications, she should clarify that the father is present in the household.
  - Now, if she ever wanted formal child support without involving the state, she could file a case with the county Friend of the Court. But that seems unnecessary if they pool resources already.


### Custody for Medical Care and Records

She might occasionally need proof of her rights as the mother (for example, to enroll kids in daycare, or if the father needed to pick them up from somewhere). The birth certificates naming her (and him, if listed) generally suffice. If she ever has a dispute (e.g., a school or doctor needs consent and father isn't readily available), remember that as the mother with initial custody, her consent is what's needed. She can inform providers that no court order exists and she is the primary legal custodian by default. It might help to keep a copy of the Affidavit of Parentage form, as it shows paternity is acknowledged which gives the father some standing to be involved in medical decisions, etc., though legally she still has final say absent a court order.

### Moving Out of State or Far Away

If they ever consider moving, note that if no custody case is filed, she is free to relocate with the children. If there was a court order, Michigan usually requires either court permission or the other parent's agreement to move more than 100 miles or out of state. Again, this is more for future consideration; currently she's not bound by such rules.

### Public Benefits and Unmarried Status

One advantage of being unmarried is that the state doesn't count the partner's income for her benefits unless they have mutual children or he adopts her children. In this case, they do have mutual children, so for programs like SNAP and Medicaid, if he's in the household and they share food, his income should be counted. For Medicaid, each person's eligibility can be separate (the kids get it easily, she gets it as a parent, he could get it as an adult if low income). For cash assistance (FIP), if he is the legal father, they'd include him in the grant and require him to participate in work activities too. They should be truthful about him living there when applying for benefits to avoid any fraud issues, but also know that not being married doesn't exclude them from applying as a family unit where appropriate.

### Emergency Guardianship Planning

It's tough to think about, but they might consider informal arrangements in case something happens to one or both of them. For instance, if she became ill, who could step in to help with the kids? Naming a trusted relative in a standby guardianship or at least having a will can ensure the children are cared for by someone she chooses. Legal aid can sometimes help draft simple wills or powers of attorney for childcare.

## Legal Aid Services for Low-Income Families

Legal assistance can be crucial for issues like her partner's driver's license, clearing his criminal record, and any civil matters (evictions, debt, custody) that may arise. In Michigan, several organizations offer free or low-cost legal help:

### Michigan Legal Help (MLH) Website

MichiganLegalHelp.org is a self-help website (not a law firm) that provides plain-language information and forms on many common legal issues (family law, public benefits, housing, etc.). It's a great starting point to learn about her rights and even to get do-it-yourself forms. For example, MLH has toolkits on filing for custody for unmarried parents, enforcing parenting time, applying for expungement, and driver's license restoration. While MLH doesn't represent clients, it can guide her on how to proceed and where to find local legal services.

### Legal Aid Organizations

Depending on her county, there is usually a specific Legal Aid office:

- Lakeshore Legal Aid â€“ serves much of southeast Michigan and Metro Detroit.
- Legal Aid of Western Michigan â€“ serves west Michigan counties.
- Michigan Advocacy Program (Legal Services of South Central MI) â€“ covers some central counties.
- Legal Services of Eastern MI â€“ covers the thumb and Flint area.
- Neighborhood Legal Services Michigan â€“ in Wayne/Oakland/Macomb for certain cases.

These organizations typically help with civil cases for those under 200% of poverty (she likely qualifies). They prioritize things like family law (especially cases involving domestic violence), housing (eviction defense), public benefits, and consumer issues. She can call the Counsel and Advocacy Law Line (CALL), which is a statewide intake hotline for legal aid (the number mentioned on MLH is 1-888-783-8190). By calling, she can see if she qualifies for an attorney for her issue or at least get advice.

### Free Legal Clinics

Many law schools (University of Michigan, Wayne State, MSU, etc.) have clinics that take real cases handled by law students under supervision. For instance, University of Michigan's Child Advocacy Law Clinic might assist with custody or child welfare issues; Detroit Mercy Law and Cooley Law have general civil clinics. Additionally, local bar associations often host walk-in clinics or ask-a-lawyer events at libraries. These are free and can provide quick advice or help draft a letter.

### Attorney General's Expungement Program & Clean Slate

Michigan's Clean Slate laws now allow many criminal convictions, including certain drug felonies and misdemeanors, to be expunged (set aside) after a waiting period. In April 2023, Michigan even began automatic expungements for eligible convictions (up to 2 felonies and 4 misdemeanors can clear automatically after 7-10 years if the person stays crime-free). Depending on the specifics of her partner's old drug conviction, he might benefit. If it has been many years and it was, say, a single drug possession felony, it might already be eligible for expungement or even have been wiped automatically this year under Clean Slate. Expungement would remove it from public records, which can help with job prospects (and possibly could have prevented the license suspension issue in the first place).

**Resources:** The Michigan Attorney General and nonprofit groups have been hosting Expungement Fairs and Clean Slate clinics. At these events, people can get free legal help to file expungement applications. She should look out for any Clean Slate clinics in their area (local news or 2-1-1 can have info). Also, some Michigan Works offices assist with expungement as part of helping people become job-ready.

### Family Law Assistance

If she ever needs to go to court for custody, child support, or a protective order, legal aid or pro bono programs can often provide representation or at least advice. For instance, Lakeshore Legal Aid's Counsel & Advocacy Law Line can give step-by-step guidance on filing a custody case as an unmarried parent. MLH also has a Do-It-Yourself custody case tool for unmarried parents to generate the needed forms. If domestic violence were a factor, she could get free help obtaining a Personal Protection Order. And every county Friend of the Court has staff who can help parents navigate child support and parenting time enforcement without needing a private attorney.

## Partner's Suspended Driver's License â€“ Legal Help and Restoration

Her partner's suspended license due to an old drug conviction is a significant barrier. Here's what they should know and do:

### Why it was suspended

Michigan (like many states) used to have laws that automatically suspended driver's licenses for drug convictions, even if the offense was unrelated to driving. This was a result of a federal mandate that Michigan has since opted out of. In fact, effective October 1, 2021, Michigan stopped suspending licenses for drug offenses not related to driving. This means no new suspensions for simple drug possession convictions. If his license was suspended before that (for example, he got a 6-month suspension for a first drug offense), that suspension time may have already passed. But if he never reinstated the license, it might still show as suspended. Also, some suspensions were indefinite until fines were paid. We should figure out what is needed to reinstate it now.

### Check his Driving Record

They should obtain his driving record from the Michigan Secretary of State (SOS). This will show what infractions or court actions are causing the suspension. It might be as simple as an unpaid reinstatement fee, or there could be multiple issues (sometimes one incident can cascade issues like forgetting to pay a traffic ticket, etc.). The record can be requested online or at an SOS office for a fee (~$12). However, the Road to Restoration clinics might help with this for free (more below).

### Road to Restoration Clinics

Michigan's Secretary of State, in partnership with charitable groups, runs Road to Restoration clinics to help people get their licenses back. At these free clinics, volunteers (including attorneys and SOS staff) review your record and give you a tailored plan to clear suspensions. They even sometimes waive certain fees or point you to resources for things like payment plans for fines. The clinics have been happening statewide. She can find upcoming events on the SOS website or by calling SOS â€“ they often require pre-registration due to demand.

Given her partner's situation (old conviction), the clinic could confirm if the law change means he is immediately eligible for reinstatement. If his only issue was the drug conviction and any mandated period (say 6 months or 1 year) is over, he may just need to pay the reinstatement fee ($125) and get his license reissued. The clinic can clarify this and even help him fill forms. Importantly, if he had other suspensions (like for not paying court fines or missing court), the new laws also eliminated suspensions for failure to appear or pay tickets for non-driving offenses. Those might have been cleared automatically, but any related fines would still need paying.

### Fee Waivers or Assistance

If the only thing between him and a valid license is money (unpaid tickets or the reinstatement fee), they should know:

- Some courts allow fee payment plans or even community service in lieu of payment for those who can't afford fines. He or a legal aid attorney can petition the court that issued the fines to reduce or waive them due to hardship. It helps to show he's trying to get on his feet.
- There was a License Forgiveness program temporarily during COVID for some charges, but not sure if still active.
- The Road to Restoration clinics occasionally have funds or connections to cover the $125 reinstatement fee for attendees who cannot afford it (sponsored by nonprofits).
- If he owes Driver Responsibility Fees (Michigan used to have these extra fees for certain offenses), note that those were eliminated in 2018 and outstanding fees were wiped. So that should not be an issue now.

### Legal Aid for License Issues

If it's confusing, he could contact legal aid. For example, Lakeshore Legal Aid had a Drivers License Restoration Project in some areas. Also, Michigan Legal Help has an online tool "Restoring Your Driver's License" that explains step-by-step what to do, based on the type of suspension. If his case is straightforward, they may not need an attorney â€“ just follow SOS procedures. But if there's any complexity (like if his conviction was for something that still requires a hearing for reinstatement, e.g., DUI which doesn't sound like the case here), then an attorney's guidance would help.

### Old Conviction Expungement

While expunging the drug conviction isn't required to restore the license (since the law changed), it's worth pursuing for his record's sake. A drug conviction can hinder employment opportunities. Under Clean Slate, as mentioned, many drug convictions (especially non-violent possession or use) are eligible to be cleared after 5-7 years. If he qualifies, they can apply through the court or wait for automatic clearance if it falls under that. Michigan Legal Help provides an "Application to Set Aside Conviction" toolkit. They might also check if his conviction is one of those automatically expunged in April 2023 (the MLH site has info on which records were affected automatically).

### Driving Legally in Interim

Until his license is reinstated, he should avoid driving. However, Michigan does allow for restricted licenses in certain cases. For drug suspensions, previously one could get a restricted license (to drive to work, school, treatment) after 30 days of suspension. If he never applied for one then, it's moot now since they've outright stopped these suspensions. But if for some reason he's not immediately eligible for full reinstatement, he could petition for a restricted license. This is usually done through the Secretary of State Administrative Hearings section. Given the new laws, likely he won't need this.

### Operating Without License

Just a caution â€“ if he's been driving with the suspended license and got caught, it could compound issues. It sounds like they avoid having him drive, which is wise. Once he's valid again, any prior "driving while suspended" infractions (if any) should also be addressed to ensure insurance can be obtained without sky-high rates. Hopefully, there are none.

### Cost of Insurance

One reason to expunge the conviction is that some insurance companies check criminal history for setting auto insurance (in Michigan, credit and other factors can be used). Clearing it might marginally help. Regardless, when he's licensed, they should shop around for insurance, maybe under her name if she has a clean record, to keep costs manageable.

Overall, getting his license back is very achievable now. The laws have relaxed these punishments because they realized it hindered people's ability to work. The state is actively helping people restore licenses through clinics. With possibly just some paperwork and fees, he could be driving legally soon, which will open up job options for him (delivery jobs, broader geographic search, etc.) and relieve a lot of daily stress for the family.

## Other Legal Considerations

### Civil Legal Issues

Should she encounter other legal issues â€“ for instance, an eviction filing, debt collection, or denial of benefits â€“ legal aid can help with advice or representation. For example, if a landlord is not making repairs or is trying to evict illegally, she has rights (warranty of habitability, proper notice, etc.) that legal aid can enforce. If a creditor sues for a medical debt or something, she might be judgment-proof (no income to garnish) and legal aid could help respond or negotiate.

### Future Marriage or Separation

If they decide to marry, it could affect some benefits (married couples have combined income counted for Medicaid, SNAP, etc., though if neither has income it doesn't hurt, and marriage might actually simplify things like the custody situation and the partner's rights). If they decide to separate, they should try to work out a parenting time arrangement amicably or with mediation to avoid a court battle. Michigan courts encourage mediation in custody cases. Also note, unmarried fathers can petition for custody or visitation even without marrying, any time after paternity is established.

### Child Care Law

When using any childcare (subsidized or not), be aware of licensing. If she ever uses an informal babysitter paid via CDC (like a relative or friend), that person would need to become a license-exempt provider and pass a background check to get the subsidy. Just something to keep in mind if a family friend is watching the kids; to use CDC funds they must register with the state. MichiganLegalHelp has info on how relatives can become paid caregivers under CDC.

### Benefits Advocacy

If she is ever denied a benefit she believes she qualifies for (e.g., FIP or CDC), she has the right to request a fair hearing with an administrative law judge. Free advocacy groups, like the Center for Civil Justice or legal aid, can sometimes represent claimants in these hearings. The single mom should not hesitate to appeal decisions; many denials get reversed when additional information is provided.

## Other Assistance and Notable Programs

Finally, here are some additional assistance programs and lesser-known supports that don't fit neatly in the above categories, but could be very helpful to her family:

### Utility Bill Assistance

We covered SER for emergencies, but for ongoing help:

- **Budget Counseling & MEAP**: Michigan has the Michigan Energy Assistance Program (MEAP), which funds agencies like The Salvation Army, THAW, St. Vincent de Paul, TrueNorth, etc. to provide comprehensive energy assistance. If her utilities are a burden, she can apply through these agencies (often via MI Bridges when applying for SER, there's a checkbox to also seek MEAP assistance). They might enroll her in a affordable payment plan for her utilities. For example, a program might cap her payment at $40/month and the rest of the bill is covered by the fund. She'll need to have income under a limit and engage in an energy self-sufficiency plan (like attending a basic energy saving class or just agreeing to budget).

- **LIHEAP and Winter Protection**: In Michigan, low-income households and especially those with young children are protected from heat shutoff during winter months (Nov 1 â€“ April 15) under the Winter Protection Plan, even if they fall behind. They should still try to pay something, but legally utilities cannot shut off heat for households with infants during winter if the proper paperwork is filed. She should inform the utility of her household status. Also, applying for the Home Heating Credit (as mentioned) helps notify utilities that she's seeking assistance.

- **Water Bill Help**: If she has her own water account (in some places renters don't, it's included in rent), she could check if her city has a water discount for low-income households. Detroit, for example, has a 10/30/50 Plan where bills are set at $10, $30, or $50 based on income and household size for those who qualify. Other cities have something similar or at least a crisis fund.

### Cell Phone/Internet

She likely already has a Lifeline free cellphone or is eligible for one (Assurance Wireless, Safelink, etc. provide free phones and minutes to Medicaid/SNAP recipients). Additionally, the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) offers $30/month off internet service for low-income households. If she isn't using that, she should apply â€“ it can potentially make her home internet free (many providers have $30 plans that become no-cost with ACP). Internet is essential for managing benefits, doing job searches, maybe online classes, etc.

### Appliance Repair/Replacement

In some cases, if an essential appliance breaks (fridge, stove) and she can't afford to fix it, she might get help from a charity or SER (SER covers furnace and maybe well pump repairs, but not appliances typically). However, local groups like St. Vincent de Paul or community action might have a donated appliance available. It's worth asking around through 2-1-1.

### Child Development and Special Needs

If either of her children (especially the toddler) shows any developmental delays or special needs, Michigan has Early On (early intervention services for 0-3). It's free evaluation and therapy for kids with developmental delays. Even if not, Early On sometimes does free playgroups. Also, the Children's Special Health Care Services (CSHCS) is a program that helps cover medical costs for children with chronic health conditions, regardless of income (with a sliding fee). Hopefully her kids are healthy, but it's good to know in case.

### Temporary Financial Hardship Grants

Occasionally, there are one-time grant programs for families in need:

- Some Community Action Agencies have "emergency assistance" funds, separate from SER, that can pay for miscellaneous needs (like car repair, work uniform, etc.). These are often seasonal or based on grants they receive.
- Crowdfunding and local charities: While not a formal program, sometimes approaching local civic groups (Lions Club, Junior League, etc.) or creating a GoFundMe can rally community support for specific needs (like if she needed a reliable used car or to cover a period of rent). It's not guaranteed, but communities often step up for a struggling young family if they hear the story (the social worker in a hospital or community center might help connect her to such opportunities).
- Investment in Families Pilot (Kent County): There's a philanthropic initiative (Steelcase Foundation's IIF program) targeting Black and Latina mothers in Kent County to provide long-term support. If she lived in that area and fits the criteria, it's something to look into â€“ they offer financial coaching, cash assistance, etc., as part of a 10-year program.

### Guaranteed Income Pilots

Notably, Flint RX Kids is a new guaranteed income pilot launching in 2024 that will give all pregnant moms in Flint and their babies cash ($1,500 during pregnancy and $500 per month for the first year of the baby's life). This is location-specific (City of Flint) and aimed at reducing child poverty. If by chance she resides in Flint (or ever moves there while still eligible), she should absolutely enroll. It's the first program of its kind in Michigan, funded by the state budget and private donors.

Additionally, other cities like Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, and Detroit have either discussed or piloted guaranteed income for a small number of low-income families. These are not widely available (often just for a select group in a study), but it's worth keeping ears open. For example, Ypsilanti had a program giving $500 a month to a cohort of single moms (part of a study on basic income). These pilots often recruit under the radar â€“ local news and non-profits would have info.

### Education for Children

Looking ahead, she might want to know about programs that can assist her kids directly as they grow:

- **Imagination Library** â€“ a free book-by-mail program for kids under 5, available in many Michigan communities. Sign up and the child gets a book every month to build up home library and literacy.
- **College Savings Incentives**: Michigan has a program called Kids Future Savings in some counties (like Lansing's "Lansing SAVE") that automatically opens a small college savings account for kindergarteners. Also, if she ever has a little savings, the state's MATCH savings or IDAs (Individual Development Accounts) might match contributions for education, a home, or starting a business.
- **Childcare Quality Programs**: Through Great Start to Quality, she can access resources to be an informed parent consumer of childcare when she uses it. Also, some areas have Play and Learn groups through Great Start that give free educational toys and materials to parents who participate.

### Case Management and Home Visiting

We talked about MIHP. If she needs ongoing case management beyond 1 year, she could consider programs like Early Head Start home-based (they can continue visiting until child is 3) or Healthy Families America (another home visiting program in some counties).

### Emergency Preparedness

Having two little ones means she should have a plan for emergencies. The Red Cross in Michigan sometimes gives out free smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors, which are important for safety. Also, she could call her local fire department â€“ they often will install a car seat properly or provide one at reduced cost (some have grants for this).

### Libraries and Museums

Many libraries in Michigan lend more than books â€“ some lend toys, science kits, even Wi-Fi hotspots. Also, with a library card she can often get free passes to local museums or the zoo via the Michigan Activity Pass program. This is a nice perk for low-cost family outings. Additionally, checking with libraries for any financial literacy or budgeting classes could help her manage the tight budget (some libraries host these and often you can bring kids).

### Advocacy and Community Voice

If she ever wants to get involved in advocating for better support (for example, pushing for child care reform or improved benefits), groups like Mothering Justice in Michigan amplify the voices of mothers, especially women of color, to influence policy. It's not direct aid, but it can be empowering and connect her with a sisterhood of women who have been in similar shoes and are now fighting for change (plus they sometimes provide child care stipends for members who attend meetings).

## Application Pointers and References

For any program mentioned, it's best to go to the official source for up-to-date info and applications:

- **Michigan's MI Bridges portal** is the one-stop application for Medicaid, SNAP, WIC, FIP, Child Care, and SER: [newmibridges.michigan.gov](https://newmibridges.michigan.gov). She can log in to apply or check her case status at any time.
- **Childcare Subsidy (CDC)**: Info and resources at [Michigan Dept. of Education's childcare page](https://www.michigan.gov/mde/services/early-learners-and-care/cdc) and an eligibility calculator at [greatstarttoquality.org](https://greatstarttoquality.org).
- **Section 8 (MSHDA)**: See MSHDA's HCV page [michigan.gov/mshda/rental/housing-choice-voucher](https://www.michigan.gov/mshda/rental/housing-choice-voucher) for how vouchers work and waitlist status.
- **WIC**: Michigan WIC information and eligibility details are at [michigan.gov/wic](https://www.michigan.gov/wic) and local WIC clinic contacts can be found via [michigan.gov/wic](https://www.michigan.gov/wic) or by calling 211.
- **TANF/FIP**: Michigan's cash assistance explained at [michigan.gov/mdhhs/assistance-programs/cash](https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/assistance-programs/cash) (MDHHS FIP page â€“ note the update to 60-month limit).
- **Tax Credits**: IRS EITC info at [irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov) and Michigan Treasury EITC page [michigan.gov/treasury](https://www.michigan.gov/treasury) for the new state boost. Child Tax Credit details from Tax Policy Center [taxpolicycenter.org](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org).
- **Legal Help**: Michigan Legal Help's guide on custody for unmarried parents [michiganlegalhelp.org](https://michiganlegalhelp.org) and their driver's license restoration page [michiganlegalhelp.org](https://michiganlegalhelp.org) are useful. Also, Secretary of State's Road to Restoration info [michigan.gov/sos](https://www.michigan.gov/sos).
- **Community Resources**: The Food Bank Council's site referencing 2-1-1 for food, diapers, etc. [fbcmich.org](https://www.fbcmich.org) and Single Mom's Connection resource list [singlemomconnection.org](https://singlemomconnection.org) (which mentions programs like FIP, MI Bridges, etc.) are good compilations.

She should take it step by step, prioritizing immediate needs (food, housing stability, diapers) then medium (childcare so she can work or study, license restoration for her partner) then long-term (education, saving, etc.). It's a lot to navigate, but Michigan does have a strong safety net if one knows where to look. By tapping into these programs and supports, she can provide for her children and work toward financial stability. And importantly, she is entitled to these resources â€“ they exist to help families like hers get through tough times and build a better future. Encouragingly, many recent changes (expanded childcare help, higher EITC, guaranteed income pilots) show that support for young families is improving.

Lastly, keeping a personal folder of documents (birth certificates, Social Security cards, pay stubs, benefit award letters, lease, etc.) will make applying for anything much smoother since every program will ask for similar proofs. Staying organized and advocating for herself (asking questions, requesting explanations or appeals when something is denied) will serve her well in dealing with these agencies. There are people and organizations ready to assist â€“ she is not alone on this journey.
