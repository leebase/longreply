# Long Reply Repository

This repository is used to store longer answers and explanations that I can easily share on web forums.  Instead of writing lengthy posts directly in the forum, I create Markdown files here and then share the link to the file.

## How to Use

1.  **Browse the Files:**  You can view the Markdown files directly in this repository.
2.  **Share the Links:**  To share a specific reply, copy the URL of the Markdown file (e.g., `https://github.com/leebase/longreply/blob/main/first-reply.md`) and paste it into the web forum.  Note that this will show the raw markdown.  To see the rendered version, you'll need to enable Github Pages (see below).

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute (e.g., suggest improvements or add your own replies), you can follow these steps:

1.  Fork this repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your changes.
3.  Make your changes (add new Markdown files, edit existing ones).
4.  Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages.
5.  Push your changes to your forked repository.
6.  Submit a pull request.

## Setting up Github Pages

1.  Go to the repository settings
2.  Click on "Pages" under the "Code and automation" section
3.  Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
4.  Select the `main` branch and save

After a few minutes, your site will be live at `https://leebase.github.io/longreply/`
