Overview

Even though they aren’t married, because she shares a household with her partner, who is the biological father of her children, Michigan and federal programs generally count his income when determining eligibility, especially if they share household expenses and food. His annual income of about $45,760 significantly influences eligibility for many programs.

Here’s a detailed breakdown by program:

1. SNAP (Food Assistance)
	•	Eligibility Impact:
SNAP considers income of all household members who share meals. As a family of four (two adults, two children), their monthly income (~$3,813 gross) exceeds Michigan’s SNAP income limits for a household of four ($3,250/month gross, as of 2024).
Result: Likely not eligible for SNAP, or if currently enrolled, eligibility may end if his income is reported or reassessed.
	•	Next Steps:
	•	Confirm household size/income reporting via MI Bridges.
	•	Utilize local food pantries, WIC, and community food programs instead.

	•	MI Bridges

2. WIC (Women, Infants & Children)
	•	Eligibility Impact:
WIC eligibility income limits are higher (185% of Federal Poverty Level). For a family of four, the income cap is approximately $55,500 annually. With $45,760, she and her children still qualify.
Result: Eligible for WIC (nutrition/food assistance, formula, baby food).
	•	Next Steps:
	•	Continue or enroll in WIC through local clinic.

Resources:
	•	Michigan WIC Program

3. Medicaid (Health Insurance)
	•	Eligibility Impact:
With income about $45,760 for a household of four, her children likely still qualify for Medicaid (MIChild or Healthy Kids) as children’s Medicaid income limits are generous (up to ~212% FPL).
However, adults have stricter limits (138% FPL, ~$41,400/year for four). Their combined income surpasses this limit, making her and her partner likely ineligible for traditional Medicaid/Healthy Michigan Plan.
Result:
	•	Children: Eligible for Medicaid.
	•	Adults: Likely not eligible for Medicaid; may need marketplace insurance (with premium tax credits).
	•	Next Steps:
	•	Keep children enrolled.
	•	Explore Healthcare.gov marketplace coverage with subsidies.

Resources:
	•	Michigan Medicaid

4. Childcare Subsidy (CDC)
	•	Eligibility Impact:
Michigan CDC childcare assistance income limit for family of four (~200% FPL) is around $60,000 annually. Their income of $45,760 qualifies them.
However, she must have an approved “need,” such as employment, school, or training. Since she’s currently unemployed and caring for infants at home, she doesn’t currently qualify. If she were to start work or education (part/full-time), they would be eligible.
	•	Next Steps:
	•	Consider workforce training, education, or employment to access CDC childcare subsidy.

	•	Michigan Child Development and Care (CDC)

5. Cash Assistance (Family Independence Program - FIP)
	•	Eligibility Impact:
The partner’s income is above the eligibility limit for Michigan FIP cash assistance. For example, a family of four must typically have monthly earnings below roughly $800-$1,000/month to qualify. They substantially exceed this.
Result: Likely not eligible for FIP cash assistance.

Resources:
	•	FIP Eligibility Guidelines

6. Housing Assistance (Section 8 and Public Housing)
	•	Eligibility Impact:
HUD Housing Choice Voucher income limits generally set at 50% of Area Median Income (AMI). A family of four usually qualifies if income is below $35,000–$45,000 annually (depending on county). Their current income ($45,760) might just exceed eligibility, depending on local AMI.
Result:
	•	Possibly not eligible, or low-priority on waitlists.
	•	Can check specific local HUD or housing authority AMI thresholds.
	•	Next Steps:
	•	Verify local housing authority guidelines, which vary by county.

	•	HUD Income Limits
	•	Michigan State Housing Development Authority (MSHDA)

7. Tax Credits (Federal/State EITC, Child Tax Credit)
	•	Eligibility Impact:
Since partner earns income, they become eligible for substantial refundable credits:
	•	Federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC):
With two children, earning ~$45,760, they qualify for approximately $2,000–$3,500 refundable EITC annually.
	•	Michigan Working Families Tax Credit (State EITC):
Additional 30% of federal EITC, roughly $600–$1,000.
	•	Child Tax Credit (CTC):
Approximately $4,000 total ($2,000 per child), partially refundable depending on final tax owed.
	•	Next Steps:
	•	File taxes annually to claim these credits, providing a substantial annual financial boost.

8. Legal Aid Eligibility
	•	Impact:
Legal aid organizations often serve households earning below 200% FPL (~$60,000 for a family of four). At $45,760 annually, they likely remain eligible for free or low-cost legal aid to address issues like her partner’s suspended license.
	•	Next Steps:
	•	Contact Michigan Legal Help, Lakeshore Legal Aid, or local legal aid organizations to address license restoration.

9. Nonprofit and Community Resources
	•	Eligibility Impact:
Nonprofits and charities generally help households below 200%–250% of poverty level. At ~$45,760/year (below 200% FPL), they’re typically eligible for:
	•	Food pantries, diaper banks
	•	Clothing closets, holiday toy drives
	•	Community Action Agency emergency assistance
	•	Next Steps:
	•	Regularly utilize community resources to supplement household budget.
