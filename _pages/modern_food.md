# ü•© Real Food for Real Health: How Modern Foods Wrecked Our Metabolism

## üìú Preface Summary

If you wanted to return to a time in human history when none of these industrial food products existed‚Äîwhen there was no refined sugar, no processed seed oils, no shelf-stable snack foods or fake cheeses‚Äîyou wouldn‚Äôt have to go back 10,000 years.

You wouldn‚Äôt even need to time-travel to the dawn of agriculture.

You could go back just 150 years, to the mid-1800s, and live in a world where:
- Most people cooked with animal fats, not industrial oils  
- Sugar was a rare treat, not a daily staple  
- Type 2 diabetes was vanishingly rare, heart disease was uncommon, and obesity was largely confined to the wealthy  
- Nearly all food was grown, hunted, or fermented‚Äînot formulated in factories

In other words: you don‚Äôt need paleo fiction or tribal reenactment. You just need to eat like your great-great-grandparents.
