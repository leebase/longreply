### Survey Note: Detailed Two-Year Self-Education Plan for IT and HVAC Integration

This detailed plan is tailored for a 10th-grader, sharp but skeptical, aiming to escape public school via GED and pursue HVAC at community college while building IT skills. The focus is on Generative AI (GenAI) and data analysis, using free resources and a Linux laptop (Ubuntu, 4GB RAM, basic specs), with internet access. The plan integrates IT with HVAC, ensuring synergy without overloading, and targets high-paying roles ($80k-$120k) without degrees, leveraging the meritocracy of modern IT. The tone is gritty, motivational, and speaks directly to a restless teen, channeling their “screw the system” energy into a “you’re the boss of your future” rally cry.

#### Background and Context
The user, a 60-year-old IT veteran from Naperville/Downers Grove, Illinois, has 20+ years guiding young talent into IT without degrees, with deep expertise in GenAI and data tools. The client, a 10th-grader, is tech-curious but thinks IT shifts too fast, sold on its joy and payoff, especially GenAI and data. Competition includes traditional four-year degrees and dead-end paths like web/game dev, which we bypass with a free, self-driven plan syncing with HVAC, not against it. The location (western Chicago suburbs) offers reliable internet and opportunity, aligning with the plan’s near-zero cost beyond laptop/internet.
