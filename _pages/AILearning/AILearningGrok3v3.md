# The Opportunity Cost of Mastery: How AI Keeps Me Ahead in a Time-Starved World

In a world awash with knowledge but short on time, **AI isn’t a crutch—it’s my edge.** After 40 years in tech, I’ve learned one truth: you can’t master everything, but you can master what matters. Generative AI hit like a thunderclap in 2022, and I’ve been using it since to sharpen my focus, not just save time. This isn’t about shortcuts—it’s about staying ahead in a game that’s speeding up.

## From Reaction to Strategy
When ChatGPT debuted, I didn’t see a toy—I saw the future of my work. With 20 years left in my career, I couldn’t let this pass me by. People used to jab: “You’re not learning when you use AI.” My take? I’m not skipping lessons—I’m choosing the ones that keep me in demand. It’s a deliberate shift from reacting to trends to shaping them, and AI’s my tool for that.

## Opportunity Cost: The Lens That Matters
Every hour spent learning one thing is an hour not spent on another—that’s opportunity cost, and it’s brutal. AI flips the script:
- **Cuts the Clutter:** I don’t waste time on low-impact skills like wrangling dev setups when AI can handle it.
- **Amplifies the Core:** It fast-tracks me into high-value zones—like AI’s role in enterprise data—where I can go deep.
- **Builds the Edge:** Pros who use AI this way don’t just survive; they set the pace others chase.

## Where I Place My Bets
Take Snowflake, my consulting bread-and-butter. It’s piling on AI features, and I’ve doubled down there because it’s where my clients live. Or local dev environments—I could’ve sunk months into Linux admin and security. Instead, I tap AI tools like ChatGPT and Warp to get it done and move on. These aren’t compromises; they’re priorities. I’m not dodging work—I’m aiming it where it pays.

## “AI Stops Learning”? Let’s Reframe That
The knock against AI is it dumbs you down. Wrong. It frees you up. I’m not memorizing trivia—I’m mastering what moves the needle, like how GenAI reshapes data strategy. Critics can cling to the grind; I’d rather win with focus.

## Straight Talk From 40 Years In
I’ve been at this since 1984—punch cards to cloud. Today, it’s not about knowing every bolt; it’s about wielding the wrench that matters. AI lets me do that, and I’m not here to apologize. Time’s finite. I’m spending mine on what’ll carry me—and my clients—forward.

## The Future’s Yours to Shape
AI’s rewriting how we stay valuable. The winners won’t be the ones who learn everything—they’ll be the ones who learn strategically. I’ve been testing this since ChatGPT dropped, and it’s working. So, what’s your next move? Stick to the old playbook, or rethink how you master what’s ahead?
