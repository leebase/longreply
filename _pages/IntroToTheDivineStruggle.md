# To My Daughters: The Divine Struggle

**My Beloved Daughters,**

I believe the Spirit has spoken to me.  
Not with *new truth*, but with **clarity** from God’s already-revealed Word — and I have to share it with the three most important people in my life.

This is something I’ve come to see with fresh eyes. I call it:

## *The Divine Struggle*

I’m asking you — with all my love — to give ten minutes to read, and much more than that to pray and ponder.  
I don’t offer this as an answer to everything, but as a lens through which some of life’s hardest tensions finally start to make sense.

### 🤍 The Premise: You’re Not Failing — You’re Struggling *Exactly as Designed*

We are not failures.  
We are not shameful.  
We are not perpetually “not enough.”

> Our struggle is not a flaw in God’s plan.  
> It *is* God’s plan — crafted with purpose, even if that purpose remains hidden.

The Divine Struggle is not an accident of the Fall.  
It’s a feature of creation.

### ❓ The Question That Haunted Me

Why does God allow us the ability to sin?

Why wouldn’t He simply create us to love Him — and we just *would*?

People have guessed at answers for centuries. Scripture doesn’t tell us why.  
But I want to take one step further — and it's this:

> God didn’t just allow for the possibility of sin.  
> He created us with a nature that *struggles*, that WANTS to elevate self over God in every imaginable way.

Adam and Eve weren’t flawless moral beings who suddenly became broken.  
They had only one rule — and they broke it. Not because they were *changed*,  
but because they were *made* like us.

> The Fall didn’t *give* us our sinful nature.  
> It gave us *knowledge of good and evil* — and with it, responsibility.

The burden of knowing.  
The weight of choosing.  
The pain of seeing the gap between what we do and what we now know we *should* do.

And *that* is where shame enters.  
Not the struggle — the shame.  
The shame comes from knowing we ought to be better — without ever being told why the struggle remains.

### 🌱 What If the Struggle Isn’t a Curse?

What if God doesn’t remove the struggle — not because He’s cruel or distant —  
but because He *designed* it?

What if the constant tension we feel between spirit and flesh isn’t a bug in the system,  
but the **stage** on which faith, love, mercy, and perseverance are made real?

We don’t know the *why*.  
But we *do* know the God who enters the struggle with us.  
Who wrapped Himself in flesh.  
Who groaned in a garden.  
Who wept at loss.  
Who bore our burdens not to remove the struggle — but to *fill it* with meaning, companionship, and hope.
Jesus who was not Plan B after the mistake in the garden.  Jesus who is Act II, following the plan in place before we were created.

### 🙏 A Prayer for You

You are not defective.  
You are not rejected.  
You are not too much — or not enough.

You are **human**.  
And the struggle you carry is not evidence of God’s absence, but the very **arena of His presence**.

I pray you receive this not as doctrine to debate, but as a gift to carry.  
A thread to pull.  
A Father’s heart for his daughters — shaped by wrestling, warmed by love, and offered in faith.

**Love always,**  
Dad
