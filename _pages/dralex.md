There is no such thing as unbiased - anything: news, teachers, books, neighbors, and certainly not AI’s.

There are three primary sources of bias in GenAI models:

- **The training data** - which are huge collections of all manner of sources.
- **The post training RLHF (Reinforcement Learning, Human Feedback)** and **RLAIF (RL from AI Feedback)**.
- **The Alignment Bias** - the efforts by the creators to make their models safe and “unbiased”. Which is another way of saying the intentional censoring of the AI model. This is a simplification but covers the essence.

For example - I follow a keto or carnivore diet and have overcome my Type 2 diabetes. I have read copious books, and have developed a POV. When I want to talk to an AI about health, I HATE having to argue and reargue that eating fat doesn’t cause heart disease. So I created a prompt to place MY bias into the AI, if only for the current chat session.

Here is the prompt where I define the POV in the person of an AI - Dr. Alex Morgan.
