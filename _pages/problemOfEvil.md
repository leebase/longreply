# The Problem of Evil

Whenever I share The Divine Struggle, I can almost hear the first objection forming:

> "You're blaming God for evil."
> 
> "You're saying God is the author of sin."

Let's be clear—those challenges are impossible to avoid.  
The very moment we affirm that God is all-powerful, all-knowing, and good, we've walked straight into the oldest, hardest question faith has ever faced:

> If God could have stopped evil, why didn't He?

Every believer who has ever looked suffering in the face has felt that tension.  
There is no clever way around it. There never has been.

## I'm Not Explaining God

I don't pretend to have an answer that solves what Augustine, Aquinas, or Calvin could not.  
God has not told us why evil exists, just as He offered Job no explanation for his pain.  
He simply said, **"Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?"**

So I'm not here to explain what God really meant.  
I'm here to describe what I see when I take His revealed nature seriously.

## The Unchangeable Premises

We start with what cannot be altered:

1. God is all-powerful.  
2. God is all-knowing.  
3. God is good.

If those are true, then the struggle that all humans live with and endure was designed that way.  
The Fall was not an accident that caught Heaven off guard.  
It was foreseen, allowed, and somehow folded into the plan of a good and wise Creator.  
Where I step in is by taking God at His word: *"It is good."*  
God looked at His creation and declared it good.  
And that included Adam and Eve—with the built-in struggle between serving themselves or God.

## The Divine Struggle

And that brings us to what I believe is the real heart of it:

God created humanity with an innate desire for self-rule and, at the same time, a divine call to submit to Him.  
We are not neutral.  
We are not totally depraved.  
We are free moral agents with a built-in conflict.

We must master ourselves, deny ourselves, and choose to love, honor, and obey God.  
That's a struggle, isn't it?  
Paul described it perfectly in Romans 7:

> "The good that I want, I do not do; but I practice the very evil that I do not want."

Whether I named it or not, we all live inside that same battle.  
The virtue of The Divine Struggle is recognizing that this tension is not a flaw to be erased but a design to be understood.

It is divine precisely because God designed it.  
It is part of the creation He called *very good.*  
God knows what He made, and He loves what He made—including the creatures who wrestle to yield.

## The Cross and the Continuance

Jesus came to redeem us within this struggle, not to erase it.  
He offered forgiveness, power, and hope—yet the conflict between flesh and spirit remains.  
That's not a failure of redemption; it's the continuation of the design.  
The same God who authored freedom and consequence also authored grace that can meet us in both.

We are completely forgiven and redeemed by Christ's grace and sacrifice on the cross.  
But has any Christian been freed of the struggle to deny self and choose God after having come to faith in Christ?  
No. Not a one. The divine struggle remains even for the Christian.

## The Trust That Remains

I still don't know why God designed it this way.  
He hasn't said.  
But I trust that He had—and still has—a purpose for evil, and that His purpose is good.  
God clearly has built in the very struggle we all live in.  
God built this struggle into creation itself; we can’t deny it—and His reputation doesn’t need us to.  
Our good and loving God created us this way and called it good.  
Praise Him!

That's the heart of faith:  
to believe that omnipotence, omniscience, and goodness can coexist even when we can't explain how.

That is the Divine Struggle:  
a world where the fight between self and surrender is itself the arena of worship—  
where our very striving to love and obey is the proof that we were made in the image of a God who wills both freedom and holiness.

And so I don’t stand here as a man who solved the problem of evil.  
I stand here barefoot before it.  
The ground is holy because it holds both our freedom and His goodness—  
and somehow, in ways He hasn’t explained, they coexist.  

That is the Divine Struggle.
