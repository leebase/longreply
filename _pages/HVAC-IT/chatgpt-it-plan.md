### Rise Up: Your 2-Year Tech + HVAC Journey

I've built my successful IT career entirely by teaching myself. I spent 5 years in college and 10 more paying for it—but only took one programming class. Here’s a smarter path: a two-year self-study plan that complements your HVAC ambitions.

You’re sharp, restless, and ready to own your future—GED, HVAC training, and a tech-driven career that's yours to shape. I'm handing you a Linux laptop paired with free tools—[Gemini 2.0 Flash, Grok 3, ChatGPT](https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2024/12/06/x-introduces-free-version-of-grok-with-these-limits)—and your internet connection. Two years—7-10 hours a week at first, then 8-12—and you’ll blend HVAC with tech into a powerhouse career. [GenAI’s your spark](https://www.fastcompany.com/91199003/genai-the-secret-weapon-for-career-advancement): learn with it, build with it, and earn top-dollar because of it. Let’s do this.

#### Year 1: Build Your Foundation (7-10 Hours/Week)

This is your launch—[GED by summer](https://www.kaptest.com/study/ged/how-to-study-for-the-ged-in-a-month), HVAC basics kicking in, tech roots planted. GenAI guides you, Linux grounds you, Python and SQLite become your power tools. Small steps, big gains.

- **GED with GenAI:** Skip the traditional grind. ChatGPT and Gemini are your free, personal tutors—ready 24/7. Math troubles? “Explain quadratics simply.” Science? “Break down heat flow for HVAC.” Writing? “Improve this essay.” GED done by June, your way.
- **Linux Basics:** Ubuntu’s your playground. Master the terminal—`cd`, `ls`, `sudo apt install`—your builder’s toolkit. [Basic Linux Command Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4WyNjt_hbQ) or [DigitalOcean Linux Guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/linux-commands), all free. By June, confidently install software, manage files, and own your machine.
- **Python Start:** [Visual Studio Code & Python Setup](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial)—free, powerful, yours. Master Python essentials—loops, functions, data handling. [Fundamentals of Python Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2EJuAcrZYU). By August, code a temperature converter app for HVAC tasks. GenAI troubleshoots: “Why isn’t this working?”
- **SQLite Intro:** [SQLite for Python Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/using-sqlite-databases-with-python/)—log temperature, study progress. By October, pull weekly averages effortlessly with Python.
- **HVAC Connection:** By December, analyze real (or mock) thermostat data with Gemini. Python scripts crunch max, min, and average temps. Practical skills, immediate results.

**Milestones:** June—GED and Linux mastery. August—Python comfort zone. December—analyzing real HVAC data.

#### Year 2: Grow Strong (8-12 Hours/Week)

HVAC training accelerates, tech skills deepen. Master Python-SQLite, lean into GenAI, create standout projects, and position yourself for top-paying jobs.

- **Python + SQLite Mastery:** Use Pandas (data handling) and Matplotlib (visual charts)—all free. By February, explore [Kaggle’s HVAC dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/felixpradoh/clima-dataset). Visualize “humidity vs. AC use” clearly. SQLite stores data, Python reveals insights. Learn [Python & SQLite Integration Techniques](https://pynative.com/python-sqlite/).
- **GenAI Expertise:** ChatGPT and Gemini become your collaborators. “How can [AI enhance HVAC efficiency](https://www.workiz.com/blog/hvac/artificial-intelligence-ai-the-future-of-hvac-services/)?”. By June, audit Coursera’s free machine learning course (Andrew Ng). Companies pay premium for this knowledge.
- **HVAC-Tech Project:** By August, develop your Python-based energy prediction model. Use Kaggle data, integrate weather from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API—free and effective. Gemini helps optimize your model—"Suggest improvements."
- **Job-Ready Portfolio:** By December, finalize your HVAC-tech project (energy saver or fault predictor). [Real-time Sensor Data Monitoring](https://github.com/mayank95b/Real-time-sensor-monitoring-system). Showcase it freely on GitHub. Explore internships on LinkedIn. HVAC meets tech—your powerful edge.

**Milestones:** February—Pandas/Matplotlib mastery. August—live predictive model. December—project polished, career-ready.

#### Why You’ll Be Paid Exceptionally Well

You're developing skills companies eagerly pay top-dollar for:

- **[HVAC Data Tech](https://jobs.carrier.com/en/job/indianapolis/quality-data-analyst/29289/71060498544) ($50-80k start, $100k+ quickly):** Trane, Carrier urgently need techs who optimize performance through data.
- **[Building Automation Specialist](https://jobs.johnsoncontrols.com/job/WD30207577) ($60-90k):** Smart buildings (Siemens, Honeywell) run on Linux, data analytics, and AI insights.
- **[Junior Data Analyst](https://www.nobledesktop.com/careers/data-analyst/become-a-data-analyst-without-a-degree) ($55-85k):** Startups want Python/Pandas skills.
