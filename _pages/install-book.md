**Instructions for Installing FBReader and Reading the Book**

Hi Connie,

Here's how to get the book "Sunrise on the Reaping" on your iPhone so we can read it at the same time!

**Step 1: Get the FBReader App**

1.  Open the **App Store** on your iPhone.
2.  Tap the **Search** icon at the bottom right (it looks like a magnifying glass).
3.  Type "FBReader" in the search bar at the top and tap **Search**.
4.  Look for the FBReader app (it has a distinctive icon, usually a book).
5.  Tap the **Get** button next to the FBReader app icon.
6.  You might need to confirm the installation using Face ID, Touch ID, or your Apple ID password.
7.  Once it's finished downloading, the app will appear on your Home Screen.

**Step 2: Open FBReader and Grant Permissions**

1.  Find the FBReader app icon on your Home Screen and tap it to open.
2.  FBReader might ask for permission to access files on your device. Tap **"Allow"** or **"OK"** so it can find and open books.

**Step 3: Connect to Your Dad's Google Drive (FBReader Network)**

1.  In FBReader, look for the main menu or a **library** icon. It might be in the bottom navigation bar or accessed by tapping an icon in the top corner (sometimes three horizontal lines or a book icon).
2.  Look for an option related to **"Network Library"**, **"Cloud Storage"**, or similar. Tap on it.
3.  You should see an option to connect to **Google Drive**. Tap on **Google Drive**.
4.  A Google sign-in screen will appear. You will need to sign in with **my Google account** to access the books. Enter the email address: **leebase@gmail.com**
5.  Enter the password for the leebase@gmail.com Google account when prompted.
6.  Google will ask for permission for FBReader to access your Google Drive files. Review the permissions and tap **"Allow"** or **"Accept"**.

**Step 4: Find and Open "Sunrise on the Reaping"**

1.  Once FBReader successfully connects to my Google Drive, you should see a list of folders and files from my Google Drive account.
2.  Navigate to the folder where I put the book files. I saved your copy with the title **"Sunrise on the Reaping (Daughter)"** or similar.
3.  Find the book file for your copy. It should have the .epub extension.
4.  Tap on the book file **"Sunrise on the Reaping (Daughter).epub"** (or whatever the exact title is).
5.  FBReader should download the book and open it for you to start reading!

**Important Notes:**

*   Make sure you select the correct copy of the book (the one titled for you).
*   FBReader should automatically save your reading progress as you go, and this progress will be tied specifically to your copy of the book because I made them unique.

Let me know if you have any trouble with any of these steps! We can start reading together soon!

Love,

Dad
