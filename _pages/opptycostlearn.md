# The Problem
There is so much fun stuff to learn and so little time to learn, let alone master, them all.   

The concept of opportunity cost is that what you spend on one item isn't the total cost.  If you buy a car for $50k, there is the opportunity cost of what you could have done with that money.

Time is more precious than money and considering opportunity cost is therefore even more important. This came to my mind when discussing my use of AI and the correct charge against me that when I use AI I am not learning.  Oh, even on the face of it, I'd have arguments, but let's just accept as a given for this piece that using AI means you learn nothing.  And I'm ok with that.  Whether or not one uses AI, this topic is still relevant as we would be wise to use our time well.

Let's consider my use case of learning AI.  When I saw ChatGPT a bit more than two years ago, I was absolutely sure I was seeing the future of IT work.  Not a someday future, but a clear and present danger/opportunity for what I do to make a living.  I have been plying my trade as a technologist since 1984.  I have 20 more years that I intend to work.  I cannot let "the next big thing" pass me by when "my current thing" will become less economically vaible in the wake of AI.  I am not referring to AI replacing me, I am talking about people using AI effectively replacing me or at minimum reducing my pay.

# The Task
I need to jump in and learn as much about AI (specifically generative AI) as I can.  I need to understand it at a survey level - broadly.  I need to pick my niche based on my current skills and positioning so that I leverage what I bring to the table to make me even more valuable as I add AI.  

Next I need to judge where I will deep dive to gain the skills that are going to keep me marketable.  I make my living providing consulting to large enterprises.  The tech stack has changed over the years, but who pays me hasn't.  Thus, I need to anticipate and respond to how large enterprises will be using generative AI in my field of data.  Fortunately for me, my bread and butter skill is currently being a principal level Snowflake (a cloud native database) and they have been adding all manner of AI features to their products.   As, frankly, has everybody else.

# The Cost
I have spent the last couple years learning in service to all that I just described.  I have reached a stage where I wanted to add local development to my skill set.

We often castigate the cloud as "just someone else's computer".  But it's far more than that.  It's someone else's admins, security experts and the like.  Setting up locally means I have to get my local environment up including OS, network, security etc.  I have been in IT for 40 years so it's not like I know nothing about these areas.  It's just that it's never been my day job to work on infrastructure.

# The Opportunity Cost
I could take the time to learn linux administration, security, and networking.  I could add a lot more to this list of all the gazillion things that pop up that I'd need to have expertise in -- all just to get to the point where I could be doing the AI learning.

# Benefitting from AI
With AI in the form of ChatGPT, Claude and the like, and with AI built into the Warp terminal and Windows OS (coming soon to Mac and Linux), I can get by WITHOUT learning or understanding.  That sounds terrible even as I type it.  It's a terrible thing to setup docker on Linux and not understand what I was doing setting up a third party repository to integrate into apt complete with signed keys.  It's a terrible thing setting up SSH and remote desktop without understanding exactly what I did, why I did, and most importantly - knowing what I don't know.

Terrible.  I agree.  It's just that opportunity cost is a real facet of life having nothing to do with AI.  All the time I save skipping the learning in these areas free up my time for the more valuable learning of skills that will keep me economically viable for another 20 years.  Or at least the next 5.

# Conclusion
One person can't learn everything.  Whether you are optimizing your learning for your career, or just for your own enjoyment - there are choices that have to be made.  I'd love to learn the piano.  Maybe someday I will.  I just have too many other things I'd rather learn with that same time.  

I could wax eloquently on how one can use gen ai to enhance one's learning.  I am also more that willing to acknowledge that gen AI also helps me get stuff done without having to learn it.  And that's a good thing with caveats.

What you don't learn can bite you in the butt.  That's true whether or not you use AI.  It's something to be aware of.  However, there is no cure for the risk as there are only so many hours in the day.  And what you spend your time learning to remove one risk, simply moves the risk to a different part of the tech stack.  

We all will make our choices.  This post is heavy on AI talk ONLY because that's the decision point I wresteled with.  Someone who chooses to avoid AI is making their own bet, spending their own time.  The person who spends time learning how to revive old motherboards won't have that time available to learn basket weaving.  

This post isn’t about AI. It’s about how we all make trade-offs in what we learn. I use AI to free up time for things I prioritize. Others make different choices. But none of us escape opportunity cost.”
