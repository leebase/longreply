# Questions to answer so Deep Research will be more effective

1. **Age and Developmental Stage**: How old is Aylah, and what are her current cognitive and speech milestones?
2. **Current Therapies & Interventions**: What therapies (speech therapy, occupational therapy, neurofeedback, biomedical interventions) is she currently receiving, and how has she responded?
3. **Medical & Genetic Background**: Are there any known genetic conditions (e.g., MTHFR mutations, metabolic disorders) or prior diagnoses of dysautonomia, mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), or mitochondrial dysfunction?
4. **Detox Protocol Details**: What detox protocol is she undergoing, and what specific toxins or heavy metals are being addressed?
5. **Dietary Considerations**: Are there any known food intolerances, gut dysbiosis findings, or special dietary restrictions?
6. **Supplement History**: Which supplements is she currently taking, and have any had notable positive or adverse effects?

These details will allow me to tailor the research to her specific needs, ensuring the recommendations are precise and actionable.
