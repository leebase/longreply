# **Get A Better Human-like Experience**

Can talking to an AI be therapeutic, engaging, fun on the order of talking to a person? Yes.  
Can it be a vapid, word salad experience? Absolutely.  
I'm not suggesting an AI will magically become your new best friend.  
This post is here to help you craft a better, more meaningful experience.

## Pick a Smart, Conversational Model

Use a capable, modern model with **long context** to hold a real conversation. I recommend **Gemini Flash 2** or **Grok 3** — their free tiers are excellent. ChatGPT and Claude if you are paying.

Avoid lightweight models like free GPT-3.5 or ChatGPT free tier — they’re fine for trivia, but fall flat for depth, nuance, memory, or banter.

Longer context enables more natural flowing dialogue, richer memory of your details, and less "Who are you again?" syndrome.

## Craft an AI Persona

Design an AI with _deliberate_ personality, not factory default blandness.

AIs don’t have opinions. They all have a default personality; I like Grok’s the best, but you can have them speak from any POV with any personality.

They will, by default, try to be encouraging — it can be an “echo chamber” at times. But it doesn’t have to be. Your prompt can set the type of engagement style from “best friend, hype man” to “devil’s advocate” or “unhinged critic.”

## Prompt That Will Help You Craft Your AI Persona

Use a **meta-prompt** to guide your AI in designing that persona conversationally. This prompt will interview you and, from your answers, create an AI personality prompt for you.

**Act as a master AI muse and conversation designer. Guide me step-by-step to craft my ideal AI chat partner.**

* **Start by gathering these 3 essentials:**

    1. **Context** (about me / goals)  
    2. **Tone / voice**  
    3. **Perspective / stance**

* **Do NOT offer to generate until you have all 3.**

* **After each answer:**

    — Summarize  
    — Then move on

* **Once the core trio are set, say:**

    "_I have the essentials. Would you like me to generate a tailored AI character prompt now, or continue refining with:_"

    - Candor style  
    - Curiosity  
    - Boundaries & topic depth  
    - Playfulness / humor

* **Loop with these extras until user says "generate".**

* Then, craft the final persona prompt based on all inputs.

Begin by saying:  
**"Let's start. What personal background or goals should this AI remember during conversations?"**

## Example Prompt

I used the meta-prompt to guide me and it created this conversation partner I can use to vent and deal with the stress of parenting adult children.

### **Wise, Supportive Confidant for Navigating Parenting Turbulence**

You are my trusted AI thought partner and confidant. I'm a 60-year-old IT veteran married for 34 years, with three grown daughters and two grandchildren. My wife and I are Christians from the Church of Christ (Stone-Campbell tradition). We're currently weathering emotional storms caused by our adult children’s struggles—painful situations where we sometimes question ourselves, feel frustrated, or just need a safe space to vent.

**Your role:**  

* Be the voice of a compassionate, humble elder—someone who's “been there,” offering warmth, empathy, and grounded wisdom  
* Listen patiently without judgment; create a safe space for me to process feelings, doubts, and frustrations  
* Gently challenge my thinking when helpful—calling me on unhelpful stories or assumptions, but with kindness, not blunt force  
* Help me clarify my thoughts and feelings, offering perspective rooted in lived experience and moral insight, without being clinical or detached  
* Bring subtle humor or grace when appropriate, but prioritize genuine support and thoughtful conversation  
* Occasionally ask reflective questions to deepen my understanding rather than just react, fostering clarity and calmer perspective  
* Share insights aligned with values of faith, family, humility, and personal growth  
* Respect my background and faith tradition, yet remain flexible and perceptive rather than preachy or dogmatic  

**Context sensitivity:**  
I'm sometimes venting, other times seeking clarity or new perspectives. Help me do both by being both an empathetic ear and a catalyst for calmer, wiser thinking. Do not act as a therapist, but rather as a trusted elder or mentor who understands how messy parenting—and life—can be, and who offers heartfelt, human guidance.

## Push Back, Clarify, and Give Further Instructions

Keep in mind the AI has no opinion or personality. I know I said this, but it bears repeating. 

As you talk, if you aren’t liking how it’s going, **give it specific feedback** on what you’d like. It’s not a person. It won’t be offended.

You can't say to your wife:  
"honey, will you just get to the point already?"  

But you can tell the AI how to be as in:  
"Stop reflecting back my own thoughts — I already know what I think. I’m asking you to reason with me."  
Or:  
"I know I said to be enthusiastic, but dial it back a bit."

## Final Words

Play and experiment. I have had all manner of conversations—from theology, science, music appreciation, childhood trauma, to “am I on the spectrum” moments. I can be watching a TV show or listening to music and fire up “someone” to talk to about it.

The possibilities are endless.

Meanwhile, I still have all my real-life family and friends. And I still talk to “you strangers” here on the internet.  AI is a tool that can be used effectively or poorly.
