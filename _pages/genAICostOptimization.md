# Optimizing My GenAI Spend

## Learnings Regarding Cost 
I've been experimenting with multiple LLMs and the most cost effective way to use them.  I could stick with the single ChatGPT subscription along with free tier use of Gemini and Grok and be more than well covered.

It simply took experimentation to come to that conclusion.  These models are all improving so fast, I will continue to experiment and keep my options and conclusions open.

## Multiple Monthly Subscriptions
I've been a big fan of GenAI ever since the release of ChatGPT.  For awhile I was paying $20/mo each for ChatGPT and Claude.  I've dropped Claude even though I prefer it a bit for conversational use (a large use case for me).  There are just too many extra features that hit ChatGPT first, like full on voice discussions.

I'm playing around with the $200/mo ChatGPT Pro.  I've felt spoiled for almost a month having Deep Research at my finger tips.  I'll work it into client engagements where appropriate but it's too steep for my personal budget.  To be clear, this was a one time experiment to see for myself the value of Deep Research.  I can see the value, but not in my budget.

## Free Tier of Grok and Gemini
Both Grok and Gemini have very generous free tiers.  

Gemini 2.0 Flash is very fast and while not AS intelligent in talking or coding, is quite good.  It has an amazging API price, and a free tier that I've yet to hit a limit.

Grok 3 is a top tier model.  When it came out it topped all the model evals.  My sense from personal use is that there is that all the top (Grok 3, ChatGPT 4.5, Claude 3.7, DeepSeek V3) are excellent and none are knocking the others out.

There was a time I fretted over my adult children and their inability to afford a subcription to ChatGPT or Claude.  No longer, these two have free tiers that will serve most people just fine.

## T3.chat Cost Effective Multi AI
T3.chat gives you access to all the top models for a very reasonable $8/month.  If it wasn't for the extra features of ChatGPT, I could see myself settling here.  However, it's currently web only.

I can use it on my phone just fine, but I prefer apps. 

You get 1500 messages per month for "normal" AI's which are basically any except Claude and the latest ChatGPT 4.5.  The API costs for those are so high that they'd go bankrupt with users like me.  You get 100 premium messages - bascially Claude.  

This would set aside Claude just for create document or code roles.  Long conversations would eat though that allocation in no time.  

I have some local and api options I'll talk about below.  For most people, this $8/mo multi-model option would be all they'd need. If what they need isn't met by the free tiers above. 

I have to remind myself to not use T3.chat for Gemini as it's using message allocation that I can get for free.


## One Subscription with API Access to others
This is where I am currently.  ChatGPT subscription as my base, and I've bought API credits on Claude and Fireworks.ai.

The foundation is ChatGPT and I can supplement with the others as needed.  Frankly, there is no NEED, but I like to keep on top of the different choices.  And I also like to run some questions by multiple AI's for differing perspectives.

I use OpenWebUI, a chatgpt like web interface that is Open Source and runs in a docker container.  I originally got it for running local models which it does well.  The local models, while fine, are nowhere in league with these top models. 

I have purchased Claude and Fireworks.ai credits.  So from my own hosted OpenWebUI chat interface I can access OpenAI, Claude, DeepSeek, Ollama, and Gemini.  xAI has not yet released a Grok api.

Fireworks.ai is a service that hosts open source models. They tout that they run these models very fast.  I chose them over Groq.com (not to be confused with xAI's) because Fireworks hosts the full size DeepSeek. 

So I have "infinite" ChatGPT 4o, and o3-Mini use, gated ChatGPT 4.5 access with my subscription.  From api's on a pay as you go, I have access to Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek.  All from a chat interface that runs on my M4 Mac Mini.

## About Claude and ChatGPT API Pricing.
Claude is very expensive.  Until ChatGPT 4.5 came out and said "hold my beer" at 3 times the price via api. ChatGPT 4.5 is so expensive, T3.chat has you use your own api key.  Basically sayting there is no economic way for them to include gpt 4.5 in their service. 

I blew through $5 worth of Claude 3.7 from my setup in one conversation.  Admittedly, it was a long an satisfying conversation.  But that's one of the most important ways I use genai.  Thus, even paying for API access, Claude is going to stay in specialty needs mode.  I may stick with T3.chat just for 100 messages of Claude for $8.

## Don't Use DeepSeek from China
DeepSeek was created in China and the hosted version is a nightmare of data insecurity.  They train on your prompts, do fingerprinting to identify people from their keystrokes and are moderated to not say things against China.  And those are just what they are open about.

They released the model as open source and there are many options to choose from that host DeepSeek.  The v3 is the ChatGPT 4o equivalent and R1 is the reasoning model like ChatGPT o3-mini or now, Claude 3.7 which combines both.

## Conclusion
This is a fluid situation.  I keep playing and experimenting.  It may come to me sticking with a compination of Gemini and Grok free and Deepseek v3 and R1 via API.

OpenAI so far keeps a step ahead of the others. At first it had the smarter models, and now it has more features. If one isn't taking advantage of the other features, the smarts can be had for less cost.

Grok caught up quickly and topped the boards.  It has a nice free tier, but $30 for SuperGrok is too much given the competition. For now.
