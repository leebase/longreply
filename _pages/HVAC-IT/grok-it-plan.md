### Rise Up: Your 2-Year Tech + HVAC Journey

I've built my own successful career in IT, it's all been self taught.
I went to college for 5 years and paid for it 10 years after that.  Only had 1 programming class.  So here's a two year self study plan to augment your HVAC plans.

You’re sharp, restless, and ready to chart your own path—GED, HVAC at community college, and a future that’s yours to shape. I’m handing you an Linux laptop  to pair with free tools—Gemini 2.0 Flash, Grok 3, ChatGPT—and your internet. Two years—7-10 hours a week, then 8-12—we’re blending HVAC and tech into a powerhouse. GenAI’s your spark: learn with it, build with it, aim high. Let’s make it happen.

#### Year 1: Build the Foundation (7-10 Hours/Week)
This is your launch—GED by summer, HVAC basics kicking in, tech taking root. GenAI’s your guide, Linux your base, Python and SQLite your tools. Small steps, big gains.

- **GED with GenAI:** Toss the old study grind. ChatGPT or Gemini’s your tutor—free, always ready. Math stumping you? “Explain quadratics like I’m 12.” Science? “Break down heat flow for HVAC.” Writing? “Polish this essay.” Try “10 GED science questions, go.” By June, GED’s yours—your pace, your win.  
- **Linux Basics:** Ubuntu’s your canvas. Learn the terminal—`cd`, `ls`, `sudo apt install`—like a builder’s toolkit. YouTube (Sentdex) or [Ubuntu docs](https://help.ubuntu.com/), all free. By June, you’re installing software, moving files, confident.  
- **Python Start:** Visual Studio Code—free, sleek. Python essentials—loops, functions, data tricks. Codecademy’s free tier or freeCodeCamp vids. By August, code a temp converter for HVAC. GenAI helps: “Why’s this not working?”  
- **SQLite Intro:** Simple database, no fuss. Log temps, study progress. TutorialsPoint, free. By October, Python pulls “week’s average temp” from SQLite.  
- **HVAC Connection:** By December, grab thermostat data (yours or mock). Gemini analyzes: “What’s this show?” Python crunches—max, min, average. It’s real-world stuff, and you’re on it.  

**Milestones:** June—GED done, Linux rolling. August—Python clicking. December—temp logs tackled. You’re rising, no cost.

#### Year 2: Grow Strong (8-12 Hours/Week)
HVAC classes humming, tech scales up. Python-SQLite deepen, GenAI’s your horizon, a project proves it. This is where you shine.

- **Python + SQLite Boost:** Pandas (data handling), Matplotlib (charts)—free, light. By February, dig into [Kaggle HVAC data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/felixpradoh/clima-dataset)—graph “humidity vs. AC use.” SQLite stores, Python reveals.  
- **GenAI Dive:** ChatGPT, Gemini—your partners. “How’s AI improve HVAC?” By June, skim Coursera’s free ML audits (Andrew Ng). Play with small models, free tiers. You’re unlocking tomorrow.  
- **HVAC-Tech Blend:** By August, build it—Python predicting energy use. Kaggle data, Pandas for insights, Matplotlib visuals. Add weather from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)—free API. Gemini refines: “Try this tweak.”  
- **Job-Ready Finish:** By December, your project’s solid—energy saver or fault predictor. GitHub it (free), eye LinkedIn internships. HVAC with tech? That’s your lane.  

**Milestones:** February—Pandas charting. August—predictive model live. December—project sharp, jobs near.

#### What You Gain: Jobs Waiting
Two years, steady effort, and you’re set—HVAC certs plus tech that opens doors. Here’s what’s yours:  
- **HVAC Data Tech ($50-80k start, $100k+ soon):** Trane, Carrier need techs who fix *and* analyze. Your Python-SQLite logs and GenAI tweaks save energy—real value, real pay.  
- **Building Automation Tech ($60-90k):** Smart buildings—Siemens, Honeywell. Linux runs systems, GenAI spots issues. You’re the future’s builder.  
- **Junior Data Analyst ($55-85k):** Beyond HVAC, startups crave your Pandas-Matplotlib skills—data’s everywhere. GenAI know-how unlocks AI support roles ($70k+).  
- **GenAI HVAC Pro ($80-110k):** AI’s in HVAC—[faults, efficiency](https://www.achrnews.com/articles/163924-the-many-uses-of-ai-in-hvac)—and you’re there. Debug smart gear, boost models, cash in.  

HVAC alone gets $40-60k. This mix? $80-120k in sight, no degree. Grab EPA 608 from school, maybe Python PCAP (freeCodeCamp), and you’re golden—trades and tech in one.

#### Why It Fits
Zero cost—Linux, Python, SQLite, free GenAI, Kaggle datasets. Your laptop’s plenty; cloud AI lifts big loads. HVAC ties in smooth—logs, predictions—enhancing, not adding. GenAI’s your helper now, your career soon.

#### The Lift
You’re not stuck—you’re rising. GED’s your start, HVAC’s your strength, tech’s your wings. GenAI’s your boost—learn quick, build smart, aim big. Two years, no debt, skills that last. While others drift, you’re fixing units, coding answers, earning big. Put in 7-10 hours, then 8-12—your time, your way.
